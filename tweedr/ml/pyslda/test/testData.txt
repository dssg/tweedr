"fellowcitizens of the senate and of the house of representatives" 	 1
"among the vicissitudes incident to life no event could have filled me with greater anxieties than that of which the notification was transmitted by your order and received on the 14th day of the present month on the one hand i was summoned by my country whose voice i can never hear but with veneration and love from a retreat which i had chosen with the fondest predilection and in my flattering hopes with an immutable decision as the asylum of my declining years  a retreat which was rendered every day more necessary as well as more dear to me by the addition of habit to inclination and of frequent interruptions in my health to the gradual waste committed on it by time on the other hand the magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications could not but overwhelm with despondence one who inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies in this conflict of emotions all i dare aver is that it has been my faithful study to collect my duty from a just appreciation of every circumstance by which it might be affected all i dare hope is that if in executing this task i have been too much swayed by a grateful remembrance of former instances or by an affectionate sensibility to this transcendent proof of the confidence of my fellow citizens and have thence too little consulted my incapacity as well as disinclination for the weighty and untried cares before me my error will be palliated by the motives which mislead me and its consequences be judged by my country with some share of the partiality in which they originated" 	 1
"such being the impressions under which i have in obedience to the public summons repaired to the present station it would be peculiarly improper to omit in this first official act my fervent supplications to that almighty being who rules over the universe who presides in the councils of nations and whose providential aids can supply every human defect that his benediction may consecrate to the liberties and happiness of the people of the united states a government instituted by themselves for these essential purposes and may enable every instrument employed in its administration to execute with success the functions allotted to his charge in tendering this homage to the great author of every public and private good i assure myself that it expresses your sentiments not less than my own nor those of my fellow citizens at large less than either no people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the invisible hand which conducts the affairs of men more than those of the united states every step by which they have advanced to the character of an independent nation seems to have been distinguished by some token of providential agency and in the important revolution just accomplished in the system of their united government the tranquil deliberations and voluntary consent of so many distinct communities from which the event has resulted can not be compared with the means by which most governments have been established without some return of pious gratitude along with an humble anticipation of the future blessings which the past seem to presage these reflections arising out of the present crisis have forced themselves too strongly on my mind to be suppressed you will join with me i trust in thinking that there are none under the influence of which the proceedings of a new and free government can more auspiciously commence" 	 1
"by the article establishing the executive department it is made the duty of the president to recommend to your consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient the circumstances under which i now meet you will acquit me from entering into that subject further than to refer to the great constitutional charter under which you are assembled and which in defining your powers designates the objects to which your attention is to be given it will be more consistent with those circumstances and far more congenial with the feelings which actuate me to substitute in place of a recommendation of particular measures the tribute that is due to the talents the rectitude and the patriotism which adorn the characters selected to devise and adopt them in these honorable qualifications i behold the surest pledges that as on one side no local prejudices or attachments no separate views nor party animosities will misdirect the comprehensive and equal eye which ought to watch over this great assemblage of communities and interests so on another that the foundation of our national policy will be laid in the pure and immutable principles of private morality and the preeminence of free government be exemplified by all the attributes which can win the affections of its citizens and command the respect of the world i dwell on this prospect with every satisfaction which an ardent love for my country can inspire since there is no truth more thoroughly established than that there exists in the economy and course of nature an indissoluble union between virtue and happiness between duty and advantage between the genuine maxims of an honest and magnanimous policy and the solid rewards of public prosperity and felicity since we ought to be no less persuaded that the propitious smiles of heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which heaven itself has ordained and since the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government are justly considered perhaps as deeply as finally staked on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the american people" 	 1
"besides the ordinary objects submitted to your care it will remain with your judgment to decide how far an exercise of the occasional power delegated by the fifth article of the constitution is rendered expedient at the present juncture by the nature of objections which have been urged against the system or by the degree of inquietude which has given birth to them instead of undertaking particular recommendations on this subject in which i could be guided by no lights derived from official opportunities i shall again give way to my entire confidence in your discernment and pursuit of the public good for i assure myself that whilst you carefully avoid every alteration which might endanger the benefits of an united and effective government or which ought to await the future lessons of experience a reverence for the characteristic rights of freemen and a regard for the public harmony will sufficiently influence your deliberations on the question how far the former can be impregnably fortified or the latter be safely and advantageously promoted" 	 1
"to the foregoing observations i have one to add which will be most properly addressed to the house of representatives it concerns myself and will therefore be as brief as possible when i was first honored with a call into the service of my country then on the eve of an arduous struggle for its liberties the light in which i contemplated my duty required that i should renounce every pecuniary compensation from this resolution i have in no instance departed and being still under the impressions which produced it i must decline as inapplicable to myself any share in the personal emoluments which may be indispensably included in a permanent provision for the executive department and must accordingly pray that the pecuniary estimates for the station in which i am placed may during my continuance in it be limited to such actual expenditures as the public good may be thought to require" 	 0
"having thus imparted to you my sentiments as they have been awakened by the occasion which brings us together i shall take my present leave but not without resorting once more to the benign parent of the human race in humble supplication that since he has been pleased to favor the american people with opportunities for deliberating in perfect tranquillity and dispositions for deciding with unparalleled unanimity on a form of government for the security of their union and the advancement of their happiness so his divine blessing may be equally conspicuous in the enlarged views the temperate consultations and the wise measures on which the success of this government must depend fellow citizens i am again called upon by the voice of my country to execute the functions of its chief magistrate when the occasion proper for it shall arrive i shall endeavor to express the high sense i entertain of this distinguished honor and of the confidence which has been reposed in me by the people of united america" 	 0
"previous to the execution of any official act of the president the constitution requires an oath of office this oath i am now about to take and in your presence that if it shall be found during my administration of the government i have in any instance violated willingly or knowingly the injunctions thereof i may besides incurring constitutional punishment be subject to the upbraidings of all who are now witnesses of the present solemn ceremony" 	 1
"when it was first perceived in early times that no middle course for america remained between unlimited submission to a foreign legislature and a total independence of its claims men of reflection were less apprehensive of danger from the formidable power of fleets and armies they must determine to resist than from those contests and dissensions which would certainly arise concerning the forms of government to be instituted over the whole and over the parts of this extensive country relying however on the purity of their intentions the justice of their cause and the integrity and intelligence of the people under an overruling providence which had so signally protected this country from the first the representatives of this nation then consisting of little more than half its present number not only broke to pieces the chains which were forging and the rod of iron that was lifted up but frankly cut asunder the ties which had bound them and launched into an ocean of uncertainty" 	 1
"the zeal and ardor of the people during the revolutionary war supplying the place of government commanded a degree of order sufficient at least for the temporary preservation of society the confederation which was early felt to be necessary was prepared from the models of the batavian and helvetic confederacies the only examples which remain with any detail and precision in history and certainly the only ones which the people at large had ever considered but reflecting on the striking difference in so many particulars between this country and those where a courier may go from the seat of government to the frontier in a single day it was then certainly foreseen by some who assisted in congress at the formation of it that it could not be durable" 	 0
"negligence of its regulations inattention to its recommendations if not disobedience to its authority not only in individuals but in states soon appeared with their melancholy consequences  universal languor jealousies and rivalries of states decline of navigation and commerce discouragement of necessary manufactures universal fall in the value of lands and their produce contempt of public and private faith loss of consideration and credit with foreign nations and at length in discontents animosities combinations partial conventions and insurrection threatening some great national calamity" 	 0
"in this dangerous crisis the people of america were not abandoned by their usual good sense presence of mind resolution or integrity measures were pursued to concert a plan to form a more perfect union establish justice insure domestic tranquillity provide for the common defense promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty the public disquisitions discussions and deliberations issued in the present happy constitution of government" 	 0
"employed in the service of my country abroad during the whole course of these transactions i first saw the constitution of the united states in a foreign country irritated by no literary altercation animated by no public debate heated by no party animosity i read it with great satisfaction as the result of good heads prompted by good hearts as an experiment better adapted to the genius character situation and relations of this nation and country than any which had ever been proposed or suggested in its general principles and great outlines it was conformable to such a system of government as i had ever most esteemed and in some states my own native state in particular had contributed to establish claiming a right of suffrage in common with my fellowcitizens in the adoption or rejection of a constitution which was to rule me and my posterity as well as them and theirs i did not hesitate to express my approbation of it on all occasions in public and in private it was not then nor has been since any objection to it in my mind that the executive and senate were not more permanent nor have i ever entertained a thought of promoting any alteration in it but such as the people themselves in the course of their experience should see and feel to be necessary or expedient and by their representatives in congress and the state legislatures according to the constitution itself adopt and ordain" 	 0
"returning to the bosom of my country after a painful separation from it for ten years i had the honor to be elected to a station under the new order of things and i have repeatedly laid myself under the most serious obligations to support the constitution the operation of it has equaled the most sanguine expectations of its friends and from an habitual attention to it satisfaction in its administration and delight in its effects upon the peace order prosperity and happiness of the nation i have acquired an habitual attachment to it and veneration for it" 	 0
"what other form of government indeed can so well deserve our esteem and love" 	 1
"there may be little solidity in an ancient idea that congregations of men into cities and nations are the most pleasing objects in the sight of superior intelligences but this is very certain that to a benevolent human mind there can be no spectacle presented by any nation more pleasing more noble majestic or august than an assembly like that which has so often been seen in this and the other chamber of congress of a government in which the executive authority as well as that of all the branches of the legislature are exercised by citizens selected at regular periods by their neighbors to make and execute laws for the general good can anything essential anything more than mere ornament and decoration be added to this by robes and diamonds can authority be more amiable and respectable when it descends from accidents or institutions established in remote antiquity than when it springs fresh from the hearts and judgments of an honest and enlightened people for it is the people only that are represented it is their power and majesty that is reflected and only for their good in every legitimate government under whatever form it may appear the existence of such a government as ours for any length of time is a full proof of a general dissemination of knowledge and virtue throughout the whole body of the people and what object or consideration more pleasing than this can be presented to the human mind if national pride is ever justifiable or excusable it is when it springs not from power or riches grandeur or glory but from conviction of national innocence information and benevolence" 	 1
"in the midst of these pleasing ideas we should be unfaithful to ourselves if we should ever lose sight of the danger to our liberties if anything partial or extraneous should infect the purity of our free fair virtuous and independent elections if an election is to be determined by a majority of a single vote and that can be procured by a party through artifice or corruption the government may be the choice of a party for its own ends not of the nation for the national good if that solitary suffrage can be obtained by foreign nations by flattery or menaces by fraud or violence by terror intrigue or venality the government may not be the choice of the american people but of foreign nations it may be foreign nations who govern us and not we the people who govern ourselves and candid men will acknowledge that in such cases choice would have little advantage to boast of over lot or chance" 	 1
"such is the amiable and interesting system of government and such are some of the abuses to which it may be exposed which the people of america have exhibited to the admiration and anxiety of the wise and virtuous of all nations for eight years under the administration of a citizen who by a long course of great actions regulated by prudence justice temperance and fortitude conducting a people inspired with the same virtues and animated with the same ardent patriotism and love of liberty to independence and peace to increasing wealth and unexampled prosperity has merited the gratitude of his fellowcitizens commanded the highest praises of foreign nations and secured immortal glory with posterity" 	 0
"in that retirement which is his voluntary choice may he long live to enjoy the delicious recollection of his services the gratitude of mankind the happy fruits of them to himself and the world which are daily increasing and that splendid prospect of the future fortunes of this country which is opening from year to year his name may be still a rampart and the knowledge that he lives a bulwark against all open or secret enemies of his countrys peace this example has been recommended to the imitation of his successors by both houses of congress and by the voice of the legislatures and the people throughout the nation" 	 1
"on this subject it might become me better to be silent or to speak with diffidence but as something may be expected the occasion i hope will be admitted as an apology if i venture to say that if a preference upon principle of a free republican government formed upon long and serious reflection after a diligent and impartial inquiry after truth if an attachment to the constitution of the united states and a conscientious determination to support it until it shall be altered by the judgments and wishes of the people expressed in the mode prescribed in it if a respectful attention to the constitutions of the individual states and a constant caution and delicacy toward the state governments if an equal and impartial regard to the rights interest honor and happiness of all the states in the union without preference or regard to a northern or southern an eastern or western position their various political opinions on unessential points or their personal attachments if a love of virtuous men of all parties and denominations if a love of science and letters and a wish to patronize every rational effort to encourage schools colleges universities academies and every institution for propagating knowledge virtue and religion among all classes of the people not only for their benign influence on the happiness of life in all its stages and classes and of society in all its forms but as the only means of preserving our constitution from its natural enemies the spirit of sophistry the spirit of party the spirit of intrigue the profligacy of corruption and the pestilence of foreign influence which is the angel of destruction to elective governments if a love of equal laws of justice and humanity in the interior administration if an inclination to improve agriculture commerce and manufacturers for necessity convenience and defense if a spirit of equity and humanity toward the aboriginal nations of america and a disposition to meliorate their condition by inclining them to be more friendly to us and our citizens to be more friendly to them if an inflexible determination to maintain peace and inviolable faith with all nations and that system of neutrality and impartiality among the belligerent powers of europe which has been adopted by this government and so solemnly sanctioned by both houses of congress and applauded by the legislatures of the states and the public opinion until it shall be otherwise ordained by congress if a personal esteem for the french nation formed in a residence of seven years chiefly among them and a sincere desire to preserve the friendship which has been so much for the honor and interest of both nations if while the conscious honor and integrity of the people of america and the internal sentiment of their own power and energies must be preserved an earnest endeavor to investigate every just cause and remove every colorable pretense of complaint if an intention to pursue by amicable negotiation a reparation for the injuries that have been committed on the commerce of our fellowcitizens by whatever nation and if success can not be obtained to lay the facts before the legislature that they may consider what further measures the honor and interest of the government and its constituents demand if a resolution to do justice as far as may depend upon me at all times and to all nations and maintain peace friendship and benevolence with all the world if an unshaken confidence in the honor spirit and resources of the american people on which i have so often hazarded my all and never been deceived if elevated ideas of the high destinies of this country and of my own duties toward it founded on a knowledge of the moral principles and intellectual improvements of the people deeply engraven on my mind in early life and not obscured but exalted by experience and age and with humble reverence i feel it to be my duty to add if a veneration for the religion of a people who profess and call themselves christians and a fixed resolution to consider a decent respect for christianity among the best recommendations for the public service can enable me in any degree to comply with your wishes it shall be my strenuous endeavor that this sagacious injunction of the two houses shall not be without effect" 	 0
"with this great example before me with the sense and spirit the faith and honor the duty and interest of the same american people pledged to support the constitution of the united states i entertain no doubt of its continuance in all its energy and my mind is prepared without hesitation to lay myself under the most solemn obligations to support it to the utmost of my power" 	 0

"called upon to undertake the duties of the first executive office of our country i avail myself of the presence of that portion of my fellow citizens which is here assembled to express my grateful thanks for the favor with which they have been pleased to look toward me to declare a sincere consciousness that the task is above my talents and that i approach it with those anxious and awful presentiments which the greatness of the charge and the weakness of my powers so justly inspire a rising nation spread over a wide and fruitful land traversing all the seas with the rich productions of their industry engaged in commerce with nations who feel power and forget right advancing rapidly to destinies beyond the reach of mortal eye  when i contemplate these transcendent objects and see the honor the happiness and the hopes of this beloved country committed to the issue and the auspices of this day i shrink from the contemplation and humble myself before the magnitude of the undertaking utterly indeed should i despair did not the presence of many whom i here see remind me that in the other high authorities provided by our constitution i shall find resources of wisdom of virtue and of zeal on which to rely under all difficulties to you then gentlemen who are charged with the sovereign functions of legislation and to those associated with you i look with encouragement for that guidance and support which may enable us to steer with safety the vessel in which we are all embarked amidst the conflicting elements of a troubled world" 	 0
"during the contest of opinion through which we have passed the animation of discussions and of exertions has sometimes worn an aspect which might impose on strangers unused to think freely and to speak and to write what they think but this being now decided by the voice of the nation announced according to the rules of the constitution all will of course arrange themselves under the will of the law and unite in common efforts for the common good all too will bear in mind this sacred principle that though the will of the majority is in all cases to prevail that will to be rightful must be reasonable that the minority possess their equal rights which equal law must protect and to violate would be oppression let us then fellow citizens unite with one heart and one mind let us restore to social intercourse that harmony and affection without which liberty and even life itself are but dreary things and let us reflect that having banished from our land that religious intolerance under which mankind so long bled and suffered we have yet gained little if we countenance a political intolerance as despotic as wicked and capable of as bitter and bloody persecutions during the throes and convulsions of the ancient world during the agonizing spasms of infuriated man seeking through blood and slaughter his longlost liberty it was not wonderful that the agitation of the billows should reach even this distant and peaceful shore that this should be more felt and feared by some and less by others and should divide opinions as to measures of safety but every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle we have called by different names brethren of the same principle we are all republicans we are all federalists if there be any among us who would wish to dissolve this union or to change its republican form let them stand undisturbed as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it i know indeed that some honest men fear that a republican government can not be strong that this government is not strong enough but would the honest patriot in the full tide of successful experiment abandon a government which has so far kept us free and firm on the theoretic and visionary fear that this government the worlds best hope may by possibility want energy to preserve itself i trust not i believe this on the contrary the strongest government on earth i believe it the only one where every man at the call of the law would fly to the standard of the law and would meet invasions of the public order as his own personal concern sometimes it is said that man can not be trusted with the government of himself can he then be trusted with the government of others or have we found angels in the forms of kings to govern him let history answer this question" 	 0
"let us then with courage and confidence pursue our own federal and republican principles our attachment to union and representative government kindly separated by nature and a wide ocean from the exterminating havoc of one quarter of the globe too highminded to endure the degradations of the others possessing a chosen country with room enough for our descendants to the thousandth and thousandth generation entertaining a due sense of our equal right to the use of our own faculties to the acquisitions of our own industry to honor and confidence from our fellow citizens resulting not from birth but from our actions and their sense of them enlightened by a benign religion professed indeed and practiced in various forms yet all of them inculcating honesty truth temperance gratitude and the love of man acknowledging and adoring an overruling providence which by all its dispensations proves that it delights in the happiness of man here and his greater happiness hereafter  with all these blessings what more is necessary to make us a happy and a prosperous people still one thing more fellow citizens  a wise and frugal government which shall restrain men from injuring one another shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned this is the sum of good government and this is necessary to close the circle of our felicities" 	 0
"about to enter fellowcitizens on the exercise of duties which comprehend everything dear and valuable to you it is proper you should understand what i deem the essential principles of our government and consequently those which ought to shape its administration i will compress them within the narrowest compass they will bear stating the general principle but not all its limitations equal and exact justice to all men of whatever state or persuasion religious or political peace commerce and honest friendship with all nations entangling alliances with none the support of the state governments in all their rights as the most competent administrations for our domestic concerns and the surest bulwarks against antirepublican tendencies the preservation of the general government in its whole constitutional vigor as the sheet anchor of our peace at home and safety abroad a jealous care of the right of election by the people  a mild and safe corrective of abuses which are lopped by the sword of revolution where peaceable remedies are unprovided absolute acquiescence in the decisions of the majority the vital principle of republics from which is no appeal but to force the vital principle and immediate parent of despotism a well disciplined militia our best reliance in peace and for the first moments of war till regulars may relieve them the supremacy of the civil over the military authority economy in the public expense that labor may be lightly burthened the honest payment of our debts and sacred preservation of the public faith encouragement of agriculture and of commerce as its handmaid the diffusion of information and arraignment of all abuses at the bar of the public reason freedom of religion freedom of the press and freedom of person under the protection of the habeas corpus and trial by juries impartially selected these principles form the bright constellation which has gone before us and guided our steps through an age of revolution and reformation the wisdom of our sages and blood of our heroes have been devoted to their attainment they should be the creed of our political faith the text of civic instruction the touchstone by which to try the services of those we trust and should we wander from them in moments of error or of alarm let us hasten to retrace our steps and to regain the road which alone leads to peace liberty and safety" 	 1
"i repair then fellowcitizens to the post you have assigned me with experience enough in subordinate offices to have seen the difficulties of this the greatest of all i have learnt to expect that it will rarely fall to the lot of imperfect man to retire from this station with the reputation and the favor which bring him into it without pretensions to that high confidence you reposed in our first and greatest revolutionary character whose preeminent services had entitled him to the first place in his countrys love and destined for him the fairest page in the volume of faithful history i ask so much confidence only as may give firmness and effect to the legal administration of your affairs i shall often go wrong through defect of judgment when right i shall often be thought wrong by those whose positions will not command a view of the whole ground i ask your indulgence for my own errors which will never be intentional and your support against the errors of others who may condemn what they would not if seen in all its parts the approbation implied by your suffrage is a great consolation to me for the past and my future solicitude will be to retain the good opinion of those who have bestowed it in advance to conciliate that of others by doing them all the good in my power and to be instrumental to the happiness and freedom of all" 	 1
"relying then on the patronage of your good will i advance with obedience to the work ready to retire from it whenever you become sensible how much better choice it is in your power to make and may that infinite power which rules the destinies of the universe lead our councils to what is best and give them a favorable issue for your peace and prosperity" 	 1
"proceeding fellow citizens to that qualification which the constitution requires before my entrance on the charge again conferred on me it is my duty to express the deep sense i entertain of this new proof of confidence from my fellow citizens at large and the zeal with which it inspires me so to conduct myself as may best satisfy their just expectations" 	 0
"on taking this station on a former occasion i declared the principles on which i believed it my duty to administer the affairs of our commonwealth my conscience tells me i have on every occasion acted up to that declaration according to its obvious import and to the understanding of every candid mind" 	 1
"in the transaction of your foreign affairs we have endeavored to cultivate the friendship of all nations and especially of those with which we have the most important relations we have done them justice on all occasions favored where favor was lawful and cherished mutual interests and intercourse on fair and equal terms we are firmly convinced and we act on that conviction that with nations as with individuals our interests soundly calculated will ever be found inseparable from our moral duties and history bears witness to the fact that a just nation is trusted on its word when recourse is had to armaments and wars to bridle others" 	 0
"at home fellow citizens you best know whether we have done well or ill the suppression of unnecessary offices of useless establishments and expenses enabled us to discontinue our internal taxes these covering our land with officers and opening our doors to their intrusions had already begun that process of domiciliary vexation which once entered is scarcely to be restrained from reaching successively every article of property and produce if among these taxes some minor ones fell which had not been inconvenient it was because their amount would not have paid the officers who collected them and because if they had any merit the state authorities might adopt them instead of others less approved" 	 1
"the remaining revenue on the consumption of foreign articles is paid chiefly by those who can afford to add foreign luxuries to domestic comforts being collected on our seaboard and frontiers only and incorporated with the transactions of our mercantile citizens it may be the pleasure and the pride of an american to ask what farmer what mechanic what laborer ever sees a taxgatherer of the united states these contributions enable us to support the current expenses of the government to fulfill contracts with foreign nations to extinguish the native right of soil within our limits to extend those limits and to apply such a surplus to our public debts as places at a short day their final redemption and that redemption once effected the revenue thereby liberated may by a just repartition of it among the states and a corresponding amendment of the constitution be applied in time of peace to rivers canals roads arts manufactures education and other great objects within each state in time of war if injustice by ourselves or others must sometimes produce war increased as the same revenue will be by increased population and consumption and aided by other resources reserved for that crisis it may meet within the year all the expenses of the year without encroaching on the rights of future generations by burthening them with the debts of the past war will then be but a suspension of useful works and a return to a state of peace a return to the progress of improvement" 	 1
"i have said fellow citizens that the income reserved had enabled us to extend our limits but that extension may possibly pay for itself before we are called on and in the meantime may keep down the accruing interest in all events it will replace the advances we shall have made i know that the acquisition of louisiana had been disapproved by some from a candid apprehension that the enlargement of our territory would endanger its union but who can limit the extent to which the federative principle may operate effectively the larger our association the less will it be shaken by local passions and in any view is it not better that the opposite bank of the mississippi should be settled by our own brethren and children than by strangers of another family with which should we be most likely to live in harmony and friendly intercourse" 	 1
"in matters of religion i have considered that its free exercise is placed by the constitution independent of the powers of the general government i have therefore undertaken on no occasion to prescribe the religious exercises suited to it but have left them as the constitution found them under the direction and discipline of the church or state authorities acknowledged by the several religious societies" 	 1
"the aboriginal inhabitants of these countries i have regarded with the commiseration their history inspires endowed with the faculties and the rights of men breathing an ardent love of liberty and independence and occupying a country which left them no desire but to be undisturbed the stream of overflowing population from other regions directed itself on these shores without power to divert or habits to contend against it they have been overwhelmed by the current or driven before it now reduced within limits too narrow for the hunters state humanity enjoins us to teach them agriculture and the domestic arts to encourage them to that industry which alone can enable them to maintain their place in existence and to prepare them in time for that state of society which to bodily comforts adds the improvement of the mind and morals we have therefore liberally furnished them with the implements of husbandry and household use we have placed among them instructors in the arts of first necessity and they are covered with the aegis of the law against aggressors from among ourselves" 	 1
"but the endeavors to enlighten them on the fate which awaits their present course of life to induce them to exercise their reason follow its dictates and change their pursuits with the change of circumstances have powerful obstacles to encounter they are combated by the habits of their bodies prejudices of their minds ignorance pride and the influence of interested and crafty individuals among them who feel themselves something in the present order of things and fear to become nothing in any other these persons inculcate a sanctimonious reverence for the customs of their ancestors that whatsoever they did must be done through all time that reason is a false guide and to advance under its counsel in their physical moral or political condition is perilous innovation that their duty is to remain as their creator made them ignorance being safety and knowledge full of danger in short my friends among them also is seen the action and counteraction of good sense and of bigotry they too have their antiphilosophists who find an interest in keeping things in their present state who dread reformation and exert all their faculties to maintain the ascendancy of habit over the duty of improving our reason and obeying its mandates" 	 1
"in giving these outlines i do not mean fellow citizens to arrogate to myself the merit of the measures that is due in the first place to the reflecting character of our citizens at large who by the weight of public opinion influence and strengthen the public measures it is due to the sound discretion with which they select from among themselves those to whom they confide the legislative duties it is due to the zeal and wisdom of the characters thus selected who lay the foundations of public happiness in wholesome laws the execution of which alone remains for others and it is due to the able and faithful auxiliaries whose patriotism has associated them with me in the executive functions" 	 0
"during this course of administration and in order to disturb it the artillery of the press has been leveled against us charged with whatsoever its licentiousness could devise or dare these abuses of an institution so important to freedom and science are deeply to be regretted inasmuch as they tend to lessen its usefulness and to sap its safety they might indeed have been corrected by the wholesome punishments reserved to and provided by the laws of the several states against falsehood and defamation but public duties more urgent press on the time of public servants and the offenders have therefore been left to find their punishment in the public indignation" 	 1
"nor was it uninteresting to the world that an experiment should be fairly and fully made whether freedom of discussion unaided by power is not sufficient for the propagation and protection of truth  whether a government conducting itself in the true spirit of its constitution with zeal and purity and doing no act which it would be unwilling the whole world should witness can be written down by falsehood and defamation the experiment has been tried you have witnessed the scene our fellow citizens looked on cool and collected they saw the latent source from which these outrages proceeded they gathered around their public functionaries and when the constitution called them to the decision by suffrage they pronounced their verdict honorable to those who had served them and consolatory to the friend of man who believes that he may be trusted with the control of his own affairs" 	 1
"no inference is here intended that the laws provided by the states against false and defamatory publications should not be enforced he who has time renders a service to public morals and public tranquillity in reforming these abuses by the salutary coercions of the law but the experiment is noted to prove that since truth and reason have maintained their ground against false opinions in league with false facts the press confined to truth needs no other legal restraint the public judgment will correct false reasoning and opinions on a full hearing of all parties and no other definite line can be drawn between the inestimable liberty of the press and its demoralizing licentiousness if there be still improprieties which this rule would not restrain its supplement must be sought in the censorship of public opinion" 	 0
"contemplating the union of sentiment now manifested so generally as auguring harmony and happiness to our future course i offer to our country sincere congratulations with those too not yet rallied to the same point the disposition to do so is gaining strength facts are piercing through the veil drawn over them and our doubting brethren will at length see that the mass of their fellow citizens with whom they can not yet resolve to act as to principles and measures think as they think and desire what they desire that our wish as well as theirs is that the public efforts may be directed honestly to the public good that peace be cultivated civil and religious liberty unassailed law and order preserved equality of rights maintained and that state of property equal or unequal which results to every man from his own industry or that of his fathers when satisfied of these views it is not in human nature that they should not approve and support them in the meantime let us cherish them with patient affection let us do them justice and more than justice in all competitions of interest and we need not doubt that truth reason and their own interests will at length prevail will gather them into the fold of their country and will complete that entire union of opinion which gives to a nation the blessing of harmony and the benefit of all its strength" 	 1
"i shall now enter on the duties to which my fellow citizens have again called me and shall proceed in the spirit of those principles which they have approved i fear not that any motives of interest may lead me astray i am sensible of no passion which could seduce me knowingly from the path of justice but the weaknesses of human nature and the limits of my own understanding will produce errors of judgment sometimes injurious to your interests i shall need therefore all the indulgence which i have heretofore experienced from my constituents the want of it will certainly not lessen with increasing years i shall need too the favor of that being in whose hands we are who led our fathers as israel of old from their native land and planted them in a country flowing with all the necessaries and comforts of life who has covered our infancy with his providence and our riper years with his wisdom and power and to whose goodness i ask you to join in supplications with me that he will so enlighten the minds of your servants guide their councils and prosper their measures that whatsoever they do shall result in your good and shall secure to you the peace friendship and approbation of all nationsunwilling to depart from examples of the most revered authority i avail myself of the occasion now presented to express the profound impression made on me by the call of my country to the station to the duties of which i am about to pledge myself by the most solemn of sanctions so distinguished a mark of confidence proceeding from the deliberate and tranquil suffrage of a free and virtuous nation would under any circumstances have commanded my gratitude and devotion as well as filled me with an awful sense of the trust to be assumed under the various circumstances which give peculiar solemnity to the existing period i feel that both the honor and the responsibility allotted to me are inexpressibly enhanced" 	 0
"the present situation of the world is indeed without a parallel and that of our own country full of difficulties the pressure of these too is the more severely felt because they have fallen upon us at a moment when the national prosperity being at a height not before attained the contrast resulting from the change has been rendered the more striking under the benign influence of our republican institutions and the maintenance of peace with all nations whilst so many of them were engaged in bloody and wasteful wars the fruits of a just policy were enjoyed in an unrivaled growth of our faculties and resources proofs of this were seen in the improvements of agriculture in the successful enterprises of commerce in the progress of manufacturers and useful arts in the increase of the public revenue and the use made of it in reducing the public debt and in the valuable works and establishments everywhere multiplying over the face of our land" 	 1
"it is a precious reflection that the transition from this prosperous condition of our country to the scene which has for some time been distressing us is not chargeable on any unwarrantable views nor as i trust on any involuntary errors in the public councils indulging no passions which trespass on the rights or the repose of other nations it has been the true glory of the united states to cultivate peace by observing justice and to entitle themselves to the respect of the nations at war by fulfilling their neutral obligations with the most scrupulous impartiality if there be candor in the world the truth of these assertions will not be questioned posterity at least will do justice to them" 	 0

"on the issue of the war are staked our national sovereignty on the high seas and the security of an important class of citizens whose occupations give the proper value to those of every other class not to contend for such a stake is to surrender our equality with other powers on the element common to all and to violate the sacred title which every member of the society has to its protection i need not call into view the unlawfulness of the practice by which our mariners are forced at the will of every cruising officer from their own vessels into foreign ones nor paint the outrages inseparable from it the proofs are in the records of each successive administration of our government and the cruel sufferings of that portion of the american people have found their way to every bosom not dead to the sympathies of human nature" 	 0
"as the war was just in its origin and necessary and noble in its objects we can reflect with a proud satisfaction that in carrying it on no principle of justice or honor no usage of civilized nations no precept of courtesy or humanity have been infringed the war has been waged on our part with scrupulous regard to all these obligations and in a spirit of liberality which was never surpassed" 	 1

"they have not it is true taken into their own hands the hatchet and the knife devoted to indiscriminate massacre but they have let loose the savages armed with these cruel instruments have allured them into their service and carried them to battle by their sides eager to glut their savage thirst with the blood of the vanquished and to finish the work of torture and death on maimed and defenseless captives and what was never before seen british commanders have extorted victory over the unconquerable valor of our troops by presenting to the sympathy of their chief captives awaiting massacre from their savage associates and now we find them in further contempt of the modes of honorable warfare supplying the place of a conquering force by attempts to disorganize our political society to dismember our confederated republic happily like others these will recoil on the authors but they mark the degenerate counsels from which they emanate and if they did not belong to a sense of unexampled inconsistencies might excite the greater wonder as proceeding from a government which founded the very war in which it has been so long engaged on a charge against the disorganizing and insurrectional policy of its adversary" 	 0
"to render the justice of the war on our part the more conspicuous the reluctance to commence it was followed by the earliest and strongest manifestations of a disposition to arrest its progress the sword was scarcely out of the scabbard before the enemy was apprised of the reasonable terms on which it would be resheathed still more precise advances were repeated and have been received in a spirit forbidding every reliance not placed on the military resources of the nation" 	 0

"from the commencement of our revolution to the present day almost forty years have elapsed and from the establishment of this constitution twentyeight through this whole term the government has been what may emphatically be called selfgovernment and what has been the effect to whatever object we turn our attention whether it relates to our foreign or domestic concerns we find abundant cause to felicitate ourselves in the excellence of our institutions during a period fraught with difficulties and marked by very extraordinary events the united states have flourished beyond example their citizens individually have been happy and the nation prosperous" 	 0
"under this constitution our commerce has been wisely regulated with foreign nations and between the states new states have been admitted into our union our territory has been enlarged by fair and honorable treaty and with great advantage to the original states the states respectively protected by the national government under a mild parental system against foreign dangers and enjoying within their separate spheres by a wise partition of power a just proportion of the sovereignty have improved their police extended their settlements and attained a strength and maturity which are the best proofs of wholesome laws well administered and if we look to the condition of individuals what a proud spectacle does it exhibit on whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our union who has been deprived of any right of person or property who restrained from offering his vows in the mode which he prefers to the divine author of his being it is well known that all these blessings have been enjoyed in their fullest extent and i add with peculiar satisfaction that there has been no example of a capital punishment being inflicted on anyone for the crime of high treason" 	 0
"some who might admit the competency of our government to these beneficent duties might doubt it in trials which put to the test its strength and efficiency as a member of the great community of nations here too experience has afforded us the most satisfactory proof in its favor just as this constitution was put into action several of the principal states of europe had become much agitated and some of them seriously convulsed destructive wars ensued which have of late only been terminated in the course of these conflicts the united states received great injury from several of the parties it was their interest to stand aloof from the contest to demand justice from the party committing the injury and to cultivate by a fair and honorable conduct the friendship of all war became at length inevitable and the result has shown that our government is equal to that the greatest of trials under the most unfavorable circumstances of the virtue of the people and of the heroic exploits of the army the navy and the militia i need not speak" 	 1

"other considerations of the highest importance admonish us to cherish our union and to cling to the government which supports it fortunate as we are in our political institutions we have not been less so in other circumstances on which our prosperity and happiness essentially depend situated within the temperate zone and extending through many degrees of latitude along the atlantic the united states enjoy all the varieties of climate and every production incident to that portion of the globe penetrating internally to the great lakes and beyond the sources of the great rivers which communicate through our whole interior no country was ever happier with respect to its domain blessed too with a fertile soil our produce has always been very abundant leaving even in years the least favorable a surplus for the wants of our fellowmen in other countries such is our peculiar felicity that there is not a part of our union that is not particularly interested in preserving it the great agricultural interest of the nation prospers under its protection local interests are not less fostered by it our fellowcitizens of the north engaged in navigation find great encouragement in being made the favored carriers of the vast productions of the other portions of the united states while the inhabitants of these are amply recompensed in their turn by the nursery for seamen and naval force thus formed and reared up for the support of our common rights our manufactures find a generous encouragement by the policy which patronizes domestic industry and the surplus of our produce a steady and profitable market by local wants in less favored parts at home" 	 0

"in explaining my sentiments on this subject it may be asked what raised us to the present happy state how did we accomplish the revolution how remedy the defects of the first instrument of our union by infusing into the national government sufficient power for national purposes without impairing the just rights of the states or affecting those of individuals how sustain and pass with glory through the late war the government has been in the hands of the people to the people therefore and to the faithful and able depositaries of their trust is the credit due had the people of the united states been educated in different principles had they been less intelligent less independent or less virtuous can it be believed that we should have maintained the same steady and consistent career or been blessed with the same success while then the constituent body retains its present sound and healthful state everything will be safe they will choose competent and faithful representatives for every department it is only when the people become ignorant and corrupt when they degenerate into a populace that they are incapable of exercising the sovereignty usurpation is then an easy attainment and an usurper soon found the people themselves become the willing instruments of their own debasement and ruin let us then look to the great cause and endeavor to preserve it in full force let us by all wise and constitutional measures promote intelligence among the people as the best means of preserving our liberties" 	 0
"dangers from abroad are not less deserving of attention experiencing the fortune of other nations the united states may be again involved in war and it may in that event be the object of the adverse party to overset our government to break our union and demolish us as a nation our distance from europe and the just moderate and pacific policy of our government may form some security against these dangers but they ought to be anticipated and guarded against many of our citizens are engaged in commerce and navigation and all of them are in a certain degree dependent on their prosperous state many are engaged in the fisheries these interests are exposed to invasion in the wars between other powers and we should disregard the faithful admonition of experience if we did not expect it we must support our rights or lose our character and with it perhaps our liberties a people who fail to do it can scarcely be said to hold a place among independent nations national honor is national property of the highest value the sentiment in the mind of every citizen is national strength it ought therefore to be cherished" 	 1
"to secure us against these dangers our coast and inland frontiers should be fortified our army and navy regulated upon just principles as to the force of each be kept in perfect order and our militia be placed on the best practicable footing to put our extensive coast in such a state of defense as to secure our cities and interior from invasion will be attended with expense but the work when finished will be permanent and it is fair to presume that a single campaign of invasion by a naval force superior to our own aided by a few thousand land troops would expose us to greater expense without taking into the estimate the loss of property and distress of our citizens than would be sufficient for this great work our land and naval forces should be moderate but adequate to the necessary purposes  the former to garrison and preserve our fortifications and to meet the first invasions of foreign foe and while constituting the elements of a greater force to preserve the science as well as all the necessary implements of war in a state to be brought into activity in the event of war the latter retained within the limits proper in a state of peace might aid in maintaining the neutrality of the united states with dignity in the wars of other powers and in saving the property of their citizens from spoliation in time of war with the enlargement of which the great naval resources of the country render it susceptible and which should be duly fostered in time of peace it would contribute essentially both as an auxiliary of defense and as a powerful engine of annoyance to diminish the calamities of war and to bring the war to a speedy and honorable termination" 	 1
"but it ought always to be held prominently in view that the safety of these states and of everything dear to a free people must depend in an eminent degree on the militia invasions may be made too formidable to be resisted by any land and naval force which it would comport either with the principles of our government or the circumstances of the united states to maintain in such cases recourse must be had to the great body of the people and in a manner to produce the best effect it is of the highest importance therefore that they be so organized and trained as to be prepared for any emergency the arrangement should be such as to put at the command of the government the ardent patriotism and youthful vigor of the country if formed on equal and just principles it can not be oppressive it is the crisis which makes the pressure and not the laws which provide a remedy for it this arrangement should be formed too in time of peace to be the better prepared for war with such an organization of such a people the united states have nothing to dread from foreign invasion at its approach an overwhelming force of gallant men might always be put in motion" 	 0

"our manufacturers will likewise require the systematic and fostering care of the government possessing as we do all the raw materials the fruit of our own soil and industry we ought not to depend in the degree we have done on supplies from other countries while we are thus dependent the sudden event of war unsought and unexpected can not fail to plunge us into the most serious difficulties it is important too that the capital which nourishes our manufacturers should be domestic as its influence in that case instead of exhausting as it may do in foreign hands would be felt advantageously on agriculture and every other branch of industry equally important is it to provide at home a market for our raw materials as by extending the competition it will enhance the price and protect the cultivator against the casualties incident to foreign markets" 	 1

"in a government which is founded by the people who possess exclusively the sovereignty it seems proper that the person who may be placed by their suffrages in this high trust should declare on commencing its duties the principles on which he intends to conduct the administration if the person thus elected has served the preceding term an opportunity is afforded him to review its principal occurrences and to give such further explanation respecting them as in his judgment may be useful to his constituents the events of one year have influence on those of another and in like manner of a preceding on the succeeding administration the movements of a great nation are connected in all their parts if errors have been committed they ought to be corrected if the policy is sound it ought to be supported it is by a thorough knowledge of the whole subject that our fellow citizens are enabled to judge correctly of the past and to give a proper direction to the future" 	 1
"just before the commencement of the last term the united states had concluded a war with a very powerful nation on conditions equal and honorable to both parties the events of that war are too recent and too deeply impressed on the memory of all to require a development from me our commerce had been in a great measure driven from the sea our atlantic and inland frontiers were invaded in almost every part the waste of life along our coast and on some parts of our inland frontiers to the defense of which our gallant and patriotic citizens were called was immense in addition to which not less than 120000000 were added at its end to the public debt" 	 1
"as soon as the war had terminated the nation admonished by its events resolved to place itself in a situation which should be better calculated to prevent the recurrence of a like evil and in case it should recur to mitigate its calamities with this view after reducing our land force to the basis of a peace establishment which has been further modified since provision was made for the construction of fortifications at proper points through the whole extent of our coast and such an augmentation of our naval force as should be well adapted to both purposes the laws making this provision were passed in 1815 and 1816 and it has been since the constant effort of the executive to carry them into effect" 	 0
"the advantage of these fortifications and of an augmented naval force in the extent contemplated in a point of economy has been fully illustrated by a report of the board of engineers and naval commissioners lately communicated to congress by which it appears that in an invasion by 20000 men with a correspondent naval force in a campaign of six months only the whole expense of the construction of the works would be defrayed by the difference in the sum necessary to maintain the force which would be adequate to our defense with the aid of those works and that which would be incurred without them the reason of this difference is obvious if fortifications are judiciously placed on our great inlets as distant from our cities as circumstances will permit they will form the only points of attack and the enemy will be detained there by a small regular force a sufficient time to enable our militia to collect and repair to that on which the attack is made a force adequate to the enemy collected at that single point with suitable preparation for such others as might be menaced is all that would be requisite but if there were no fortifications then the enemy might go where he pleased and changing his position and sailing from place to place our force must be called out and spread in vast numbers along the whole coast and on both sides of every bay and river as high up in each as it might be navigable for ships of war by these fortifications supported by our navy to which they would afford like support we should present to other powers an armed front from st croix to the sabine which would protect in the event of war our whole coast and interior from invasion and even in the wars of other powers in which we were neutral they would be found eminently useful as by keeping their public ships at a distance from our cities peace and order in them would be preserved and the government be protected from insult" 	 0
"it need scarcely be remarked that these measures have not been resorted to in a spirit of hostility to other powers such a disposition does not exist toward any power peace and good will have been and will hereafter be cultivated with all and by the most faithful regard to justice they have been dictated by a love of peace of economy and an earnest desire to save the lives of our fellow citizens from that destruction and our country from that devastation which are inseparable from war when it finds us unprepared for it it is believed and experience has shown that such a preparation is the best expedient that can be resorted to prevent war i add with much pleasure that considerable progress has already been made in these measures of defense and that they will be completed in a few years considering the great extent and importance of the object if the plan be zealously and steadily persevered in" 	 0

"at the period adverted to the powers of europe after having been engaged in long and destructive wars with each other had concluded a peace which happily still exists our peace with the power with whom we had been engaged had also been concluded the war between spain and the colonies in south america which had commenced many years before was then the only conflict that remained unsettled this being a contest between different parts of the same community in which other powers had not interfered was not affected by their accommodations" 	 0
"this contest was considered at an early stage by my predecessor a civil war in which the parties were entitled to equal rights in our ports this decision the first made by any power being formed on great consideration of the comparative strength and resources of the parties the length of time and successful opposition made by the colonies and of all other circumstances on which it ought to depend was in strict accord with the law of nations congress has invariably acted on this principle having made no change in our relations with either party our attitude has therefore been that of neutrality between them which has been maintained by the government with the strictest impartiality no aid has been afforded to either nor has any privilege been enjoyed by the one which has not been equally open to the other party and every exertion has been made in its power to enforce the execution of the laws prohibiting illegal equipments with equal rigor against both" 	 0
"by this equality between the parties their public vessels have been received in our ports on the same footing they have enjoyed an equal right to purchase and export arms munitions of war and every other supply the exportation of all articles whatever being permitted under laws which were passed long before the commencement of the contest our citizens have traded equally with both and their commerce with each has been alike protected by the government" 	 0
"respecting the attitude which it may be proper for the united states to maintain hereafter between the parties i have no hesitation in stating it as my opinion that the neutrality heretofore observed should still be adhered to from the change in the government of spain and the negotiation now depending invited by the cortes and accepted by the colonies it may be presumed that their differences will be settled on the terms proposed by the colonies should the war be continued the united states regarding its occurrences will always have it in their power to adopt such measures respecting it as their honor and interest may require" 	 0
"shortly after the general peace a band of adventurers took advantage of this conflict and of the facility which it afforded to establish a system of buccaneering in the neighboring seas to the great annoyance of the commerce of the united states and as was represented of that of other powers of this spirit and of its injurious bearing on the united states strong proofs were afforded by the establishment at amelia island and the purposes to which it was made instrumental by this band in 1817 and by the occurrences which took place in other parts of florida in 1818 the details of which in both instances are too well known to require to be now recited i am satisfied had a less decisive course been adopted that the worst consequences would have resulted from it we have seen that these checks decisive as they were were not sufficient to crush that piratical spirit many culprits brought within our limits have been condemned to suffer death the punishment due to that atrocious crime the decisions of upright and enlightened tribunals fall equally on all whose crimes subject them by a fair interpretation of the law to its censure it belongs to the executive not to suffer the executions under these decisions to transcend the great purpose for which punishment is necessary the full benefit of example being secured policy as well as humanity equally forbids that they should be carried further i have acted on this principle pardoning those who appear to have been led astray by ignorance of the criminality of the acts they had committed and suffering the law to take effect on those only in whose favor no extenuating circumstances could be urged" 	 0
"great confidence is entertained that the late treaty with spain which has been ratified by both the parties and the ratifications whereof have been exchanged has placed the relations of the two countries on a basis of permanent friendship the provision made by it for such of our citizens as have claims on spain of the character described will it is presumed be very satisfactory to them and the boundary which is established between the territories of the parties westward of the mississippi heretofore in dispute has it is thought been settled on conditions just and advantageous to both but to the acquisition of florida too much importance can not be attached it secures to the united states a territory important in itself and whose importance is much increased by its bearing on many of the highest interests of the union it opens to several of the neighboring states a free passage to the ocean through the province ceded by several rivers having their sources high up within their limits it secures us against all future annoyance from powerful indian tribes it gives us several excellent harbors in the gulf of mexico for ships of war of the largest size it covers by its position in the gulf the mississippi and other great waters within our extended limits and thereby enables the united states to afford complete protection to the vast and very valuable productions of our whole western country which find a market through those streams" 	 0
"by a treaty with the british government bearing date on the 20th of october 1818 the convention regulating the commerce between the united states and great britain concluded on the 3d of july 1815 which was about expiring was revived and continued for the term of ten years from the time of its expiration by that treaty also the differences which had arisen under the treaty of ghent respecting the right claimed by the united states for their citizens to take and cure fish on the coast of his britannic majestys dominions in america with other differences on important interests were adjusted to the satisfaction of both parties no agreement has yet been entered into respecting the commerce between the united states and the british dominions in the west indies and on this continent the restraints imposed on that commerce by great britain and reciprocated by the united states on a principle of defense continue still in force" 	 0
"the negotiation with france for the regulation of the commercial relations between the two countries which in the course of the last summer had been commenced at paris has since been transferred to this city and will be pursued on the part of the united states in the spirit of conciliation and with an earnest desire that it may terminate in an arrangement satisfactory to both parties" 	 0
"our relations with the barbary powers are preserved in the same state and by the same means that were employed when i came into this office as early as 1801 it was found necessary to send a squadron into the mediterranean for the protection of our commerce and no period has intervened a short term excepted when it was thought advisable to withdraw it the great interests which the united states have in the pacific in commerce and in the fisheries have also made it necessary to maintain a naval force there in disposing of this force in both instances the most effectual measures in our power have been taken without interfering with its other duties for the suppression of the slave trade and of piracy in the neighboring seas" 	 0
"the situation of the united states in regard to their resources the extent of their revenue and the facility with which it is raised affords a most gratifying spectacle the payment of nearly 67000000 of the public debt with the great progress made in measures of defense and in other improvements of various kinds since the late war are conclusive proofs of this extraordinary prosperity especially when it is recollected that these expenditures have been defrayed without a burthen on the people the direct tax and excise having been repealed soon after the conclusion of the late war and the revenue applied to these great objects having been raised in a manner not to be felt our great resources therefore remain untouched for any purpose which may affect the vital interests of the nation for all such purposes they are inexhaustible they are more especially to be found in the virtue patriotism and intelligence of our fellow citizens and in the devotion with which they would yield up by any just measure of taxation all their property in support of the rights and honor of their country" 	 1
"under the present depression of prices affecting all the productions of the country and every branch of industry proceeding from causes explained on a former occasion the revenue has considerably diminished the effect of which has been to compel congress either to abandon these great measures of defense or to resort to loans or internal taxes to supply the deficiency on the presumption that this depression and the deficiency in the revenue arising from it would be temporary loans were authorized for the demands of the last and present year anxious to relieve my fellow citizens in 1817 from every burthen which could be dispensed with and the state of the treasury permitting it i recommended the repeal of the internal taxes knowing that such relief was then peculiarly necessary in consequence of the great exertions made in the late war i made that recommendation under a pledge that should the public exigencies require a recurrence to them at any time while i remained in this trust i would with equal promptitude perform the duty which would then be alike incumbent on me by the experiment now making it will be seen by the next session of congress whether the revenue shall have been so augmented as to be adequate to all these necessary purposes should the deficiency still continue and especially should it be probable that it would be permanent the course to be pursued appears to me to be obvious i am satisfied that under certain circumstances loans may be resorted to with great advantage i am equally well satisfied as a general rule that the demands of the current year especially in time of peace should be provided for by the revenue of that year" 	 1
"i have never dreaded nor have i ever shunned in any situation in which i have been placed making appeals to the virtue and patriotism of my fellow citizens well knowing that they could never be made in vain especially in times of great emergency or for purposes of high national importance independently of the exigency of the case many considerations of great weight urge a policy having in view a provision of revenue to meet to a certain extent the demands of the nation without relying altogether on the precarious resource of foreign commerce i am satisfied that internal duties and excises with corresponding imposts on foreign articles of the same kind would without imposing any serious burdens on the people enhance the price of produce promote our manufactures and augment the revenue at the same time that they made it more secure and permanent" 	 1
"the care of the indian tribes within our limits has long been an essential part of our system but unfortunately it has not been executed in a manner to accomplish all the objects intended by it we have treated them as independent nations without their having any substantial pretensions to that rank the distinction has flattered their pride retarded their improvement and in many instances paved the way to their destruction the progress of our settlements westward supported as they are by a dense population has constantly driven them back with almost the total sacrifice of the lands which they have been compelled to abandon they have claims on the magnanimity and i may add on the justice of this nation which we must all feel we should become their real benefactors we should perform the office of their great father the endearing title which they emphatically give to the chief magistrate of our union their sovereignty over vast territories should cease in lieu of which the right of soil should be secured to each individual and his posterity in competent portions and for the territory thus ceded by each tribe some reasonable equivalent should be granted to be vested in permanent funds for the support of civil government over them and for the education of their children for their instruction in the arts of husbandry and to provide sustenance for them until they could provide it for themselves my earnest hope is that congress will digest some plan founded on these principles with such improvements as their wisdom may suggest and carry it into effect as soon as it may be practicable" 	 1
"europe is again unsettled and the prospect of war increasing should the flame light up in any quarter how far it may extend it is impossible to foresee it is our peculiar felicity to be altogether unconnected with the causes which produce this menacing aspect elsewhere with every power we are in perfect amity and it is our interest to remain so if it be practicable on just conditions i see no reasonable cause to apprehend variance with any power unless it proceed from a violation of our maritime rights in these contests should they occur and to whatever extent they may be carried we shall be neutral but as a neutral power we have rights which it is our duty to maintain for like injuries it will be incumbent on us to seek redress in a spirit of amity in full confidence that injuring none none would knowingly injure us for more imminent dangers we should be prepared and it should always be recollected that such preparation adapted to the circumstances and sanctioned by the judgment and wishes of our constituents can not fail to have a good effect in averting dangers of every kind we should recollect also that the season of peace is best adapted to these preparations" 	 0
"if we turn our attention fellow citizens more immediately to the internal concerns of our country and more especially to those on which its future welfare depends we have every reason to anticipate the happiest results it is now rather more than fortyfour years since we declared our independence and thirtyseven since it was acknowledged the talents and virtues which were displayed in that great struggle were a sure presage of all that has since followed a people who were able to surmount in their infant state such great perils would be more competent as they rose into manhood to repel any which they might meet in their progress their physical strength would be more adequate to foreign danger and the practice of selfgovernment aided by the light of experience could not fail to produce an effect equally salutary on all those questions connected with the internal organization these favorable anticipations have been realized" 	 0
"in our whole system national and state we have shunned all the defects which unceasingly preyed on the vitals and destroyed the ancient republics in them there were distinct orders a nobility and a people or the people governed in one assembly thus in the one instance there was a perpetual conflict between the orders in society for the ascendency in which the victory of either terminated in the overthrow of the government and the ruin of the state in the other in which the people governed in a body and whose dominions seldom exceeded the dimensions of a county in one of our states a tumultuous and disorderly movement permitted only a transitory existence in this great nation there is but one order that of the people whose power by a peculiarly happy improvement of the representative principle is transferred from them without impairing in the slightest degree their sovereignty to bodies of their own creation and to persons elected by themselves in the full extent necessary for all the purposes of free enlightened and efficient government the whole system is elective the complete sovereignty being in the people and every officer in every department deriving his authority from and being responsible to them for his conduct" 	 1
"our career has corresponded with this great outline perfection in our organization could not have been expected in the outset either in the national or state governments or in tracing the line between their respective powers but no serious conflict has arisen nor any contest but such as are managed by argument and by a fair appeal to the good sense of the people and many of the defects which experience had clearly demonstrated in both governments have been remedied by steadily pursuing this course in this spirit there is every reason to believe that our system will soon attain the highest degree of perfection of which human institutions are capable and that the movement in all its branches will exhibit such a degree of order and harmony as to command the admiration and respect of the civilized world" 	 1
"our physical attainments have not been less eminent twentyfive years ago the river mississippi was shut up and our western brethren had no outlet for their commerce what has been the progress since that time the river has not only become the property of the united states from its source to the ocean with all its tributary streams with the exception of the upper part of the red river only but louisiana with a fair and liberal boundary on the western side and the floridas on the eastern have been ceded to us the united states now enjoy the complete and uninterrupted sovereignty over the whole territory from st croix to the sabine new states settled from among ourselves in this and in other parts have been admitted into our union in equal participation in the national sovereignty with the original states our population has augmented in an astonishing degree and extended in every direction we now fellow citizens comprise within our limits the dimensions and faculties of a great power under a government possessing all the energies of any government ever known to the old world with an utter incapacity to oppress the people" 	 1

"in the compass of thirtysix years since this great national covenant was instituted a body of laws enacted under its authority and in conformity with its provisions has unfolded its powers and carried into practical operation its effective energies subordinate departments have distributed the executive functions in their various relations to foreign affairs to the revenue and expenditures and to the military force of the union by land and sea a coordinate department of the judiciary has expounded the constitution and the laws settling in harmonious coincidence with the legislative will numerous weighty questions of construction which the imperfection of human language had rendered unavoidable the year of jubilee since the first formation of our union has just elapsed that of the declaration of our independence is at hand the consummation of both was effected by this constitution" 	 0

"such is the unexaggerated picture of our condition under a constitution founded upon the republican principle of equal rights to admit that this picture has its shades is but to say that it is still the condition of men upon earth from evil  physical moral and political  it is not our claim to be exempt we have suffered sometimes by the visitation of heaven through disease often by the wrongs and injustice of other nations even to the extremities of war and lastly by dissensions among ourselves  dissensions perhaps inseparable from the enjoyment of freedom but which have more than once appeared to threaten the dissolution of the union and with it the overthrow of all the enjoyments of our present lot and all our earthly hopes of the future the causes of these dissensions have been various founded upon differences of speculation in the theory of republican government upon conflicting views of policy in our relations with foreign nations upon jealousies of partial and sectional interests aggravated by prejudices and prepossessions which strangers to each other are ever apt to entertain" 	 1

"the collisions of party spirit which originate in speculative opinions or in different views of administrative policy are in their nature transitory those which are founded on geographical divisions adverse interests of soil climate and modes of domestic life are more permanent and therefore perhaps more dangerous it is this which gives inestimable value to the character of our government at once federal and national it holds out to us a perpetual admonition to preserve alike and with equal anxiety the rights of each individual state in its own government and the rights of the whole nation in that of the union whatsoever is of domestic concernment unconnected with the other members of the union or with foreign lands belongs exclusively to the administration of the state governments whatsoever directly involves the rights and interests of the federative fraternity or of foreign powers is of the resort of this general government the duties of both are obvious in the general principle though sometimes perplexed with difficulties in the detail to respect the rights of the state governments is the inviolable duty of that of the union the government of every state will feel its own obligation to respect and preserve the rights of the whole the prejudices everywhere too commonly entertained against distant strangers are worn away and the jealousies of jarring interests are allayed by the composition and functions of the great national councils annually assembled from all quarters of the union at this place here the distinguished men from every section of our country while meeting to deliberate upon the great interests of those by whom they are deputed learn to estimate the talents and do justice to the virtues of each other the harmony of the nation is promoted and the whole union is knit together by the sentiments of mutual respect the habits of social intercourse and the ties of personal friendship formed between the representatives of its several parts in the performance of their service at this metropolis" 	 1

"in this brief outline of the promise and performance of my immediate predecessor the line of duty for his successor is clearly delineated to pursue to their consummation those purposes of improvement in our common condition instituted or recommended by him will embrace the whole sphere of my obligations to the topic of internal improvement emphatically urged by him at his inauguration i recur with peculiar satisfaction it is that from which i am convinced that the unborn millions of our posterity who are in future ages to people this continent will derive their most fervent gratitude to the founders of the union that in which the beneficent action of its government will be most deeply felt and acknowledged the magnificence and splendor of their public works are among the imperishable glories of the ancient republics the roads and aqueducts of rome have been the admiration of all afte ages and have survived thousands of years after all her conquests have been swallowed up in despotism or become the spoil of barbarians some diversity of opinion has prevailed with regard to the powers of congress for legislation upon objects of this nature the most respectful deference is due to doubts originating in pure patriotism and sustained by venerated authority but nearly twenty years have passed since the construction of the first national road was commenced the authority for its construction was then unquestioned to how many thousands of our countrymen has it proved a benefit to what single individual has it ever proved an injury repeated liberal and candid discussions in the legislature have conciliated the sentiments and approximated the opinions of enlightened minds upon the question of constitutional power i can not but hope that by the same process of friendly patient and persevering deliberation all constitutional objections will ultimately be removed the extent and limitation of the powers of the general government in relation to this transcendently important interest will be settled and acknowledged to the common satisfaction of all and every speculative scruple will be solved by a practical public blessing" 	 0

"with regard to a proper selection of the subjects of impost with a view to revenue it would seem to me that the spirit of equity caution and compromise in which the constitution was formed requires that the great interests of agriculture commerce and manufactures should be equally favored and that perhaps the only exception to this rule should consist in the peculiar encouragement of any products of either of them that may be found essential to our national independence" 	 1

"so many events have occurred within the last four years which have necessarily called forth  sometimes under circumstances the most delicate and painful  my views of the principles and policy which ought to be pursued by the general government that i need on this occasion but allude to a few leading considerations connected with some of them" 	 0
"the foreign policy adopted by our government soon after the formation of our present constitution and very generally pursued by successive administrations has been crowned with almost complete success and has elevated our character among the nations of the earth to do justice to all and to submit to wrong from none has been during my administration its governing maxim and so happy have been its results that we are not only at peace with all the world but have few causes of controversy and those of minor importance remaining unadjusted" 	 1
"in the domestic policy of this government there are two objects which especially deserve the attention of the people and their representatives and which have been and will continue to be the subjects of my increasing solicitude they are the preservation of the rights of the several states and the integrity of the union" 	 0
"these great objects are necessarily connected and can only be attained by an enlightened exercise of the powers of each within its appropriate sphere in conformity with the public will constitutionally expressed to this end it becomes the duty of all to yield a ready and patriotic submission to the laws constitutionally enacted and thereby promote and strengthen a proper confidence in those institutions of the several states and of the united states which the people themselves have ordained for their own government" 	 0
"my experience in public concerns and the observation of a life somewhat advanced confirm the opinions long since imbibed by me that the destruction of our state governments or the annihilation of their control over the local concerns of the people would lead directly to revolution and anarchy and finally to despotism and military domination in proportion therefore as the general government encroaches upon the rights of the states in the same proportion does it impair its own power and detract from its ability to fulfill the purposes of its creation solemnly impressed with these considerations my countrymen will ever find me ready to exercise my constitutional powers in arresting measures which may directly or indirectly encroach upon the rights of the states or tend to consolidate all political power in the general government but of equal and indeed of incalculable importance is the union of these states and the sacred duty of all to contribute to its preservation by a liberal support of the general government in the exercise of its just powers you have been wisely admonished to accustom yourselves to think and speak of the union as of the palladium of your political safety and prosperity watching for its preservation with jealous anxiety discountenancing whatever may suggest even a suspicion that it can in any event be abandoned and indignantly frowning upon the first dawning of any attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the various parts without union our independence and liberty would never have been achieved without union they never can be maintained divided into twentyfour or even a smaller number of separate communities we shall see our internal trade burdened with numberless restraints and exactions communication between distant points and sections obstructed or cut off our sons made soldiers to deluge with blood the fields they now till in peace the mass of our people borne down and impoverished by taxes to support armies and navies and military leaders at the head of their victorious legions becoming our lawgivers and judges the loss of liberty of all good government of peace plenty and happiness must inevitably follow a dissolution of the union in supporting it therefore we support all that is dear to the freeman and the philanthropist" 	 1
"the time at which i stand before you is full of interest the eyes of all nations are fixed on our republic the event of the existing crisis will be decisive in the opinion of mankind of the practicability of our federal system of government great is the stake placed in our hands great is the responsibility which must rest upon the people of the united states let us realize the importance of the attitude in which we stand before the world let us exercise forbearance and firmness let us extricate our country from the dangers which surround it and learn wisdom from the lessons they inculcate" 	 1
"deeply impressed with the truth of these observations and under the obligation of that solemn oath which i am about to take i shall continue to exert all my faculties to maintain the just powers of the constitution and to transmit unimpaired to posterity the blessings of our federal union at the same time it will be my aim to inculcate by my official acts the necessity of exercising by the general government those powers only that are clearly delegated to encourage simplicity and economy in the expenditures of the government to raise no more money from the people than may be requisite for these objects and in a manner that will best promote the interests of all classes of the community and of all portions of the union constantly bearing in mind that in entering into society individuals must give up a share of liberty to preserve the rest it will be my desire so to discharge my duties as to foster with our brethren in all parts of the country a spirit of liberal concession and compromise and by reconciling our fellow citizens to those partial sacrifices which they must unavoidably make for the preservation of a greater good to recommend our invaluable government and union to the confidence and affections of the american people" 	 1
"finally it is my most fervent prayer to that almighty being before whom i now stand and who has kept us in his hands from the infancy of our republic to the present day that he will so overrule all my intentions and actions and inspire the hearts of my fellow citizens that we may be preserved from dangers of all kinds and continue forever a united and happy peoplefellow citizens the practice of all my predecessors imposes on me an obligation i cheerfully fulfill  to accompany the first and solemn act of my public trust with an avowal of the principles that will guide me in performing it and an expression of my feelings on assuming a charge so responsible and vast in imitating their example i tread in the footsteps of illustrious men whose superiors it is our happiness to believe are not found on the executive calendar of any country among them we recognize the earliest and firmest pillars of the republic  those by whom our national independence was first declared him who above all others contributed to establish it on the field of battle and those whose expanded intellect and patriotism constructed improved and perfected the inestimable institutions under which we live if such men in the position i now occupy felt themselves overwhelmed by a sense of gratitude for this the highest of all marks of their countrys confidence and by a consciousness of their inability adequately to discharge the duties of an office so difficult and exalted how much more must these considerations affect one who can rely on no such claims for favor or forbearance unlike all who have preceded me the revolution that gave us existence as one people was achieved at the period of my birth and whilst i contemplate with grateful reverence that memorable event i feel that i belong to a later age and that i may not expect my countrymen to weigh my actions with the same kind and partial hand" 	 1
"so sensibly fellow citizens do these circumstances press themselves upon me that i should not dare to enter upon my path of duty did i not look for the generous aid of those who will be associated with me in the various and coordinate branches of the government did i not repose with unwavering reliance on the patriotism the intelligence and the kindness of a people who never yet deserted a public servant honestly laboring their cause and above all did i not permit myself humbly to hope for the sustaining support of an everwatchful and beneficent providence" 	 1
"to the confidence and consolation derived from these sources it would be ungrateful not to add those which spring from our present fortunate condition though not altogether exempt from embarrassments that disturb our tranquillity at home and threaten it abroad yet in all the attributes of a great happy and flourishing people we stand without a parallel in the world abroad we enjoy the respect and with scarcely an exception the friendship of every nation at home while our government quietly but efficiently performs the sole legitimate end of political institutions  in doing the greatest good to the greatest number  we present an aggregate of human prosperity surely not elsewhere to be found" 	 1
"how imperious then is the obligation imposed upon every citizen in his own sphere of action whether limited or extended to exert himself in perpetuating a condition of things so singularly happy all the lessons of history and experience must be lost upon us if we are content to trust alone to the peculiar advantages we happen to possess position and climate and the bounteous resources that nature has scattered with so liberal a hand  even the diffused intelligence and elevated character of our people  will avail us nothing if we fail sacredly to uphold those political institutions that were wisely and deliberately formed with reference to every circumstance that could preserve or might endanger the blessings we enjoy the thoughtful framers of our constitution legislated for our country as they found it looking upon it with the eyes of statesmen and patriots they saw all the sources of rapid and wonderful prosperity but they saw also that various habits opinions and institutions peculiar to the various portions of so vast a region were deeply fixed distinct sovereignties were in actual existence whose cordial union was essential to the welfare and happiness of all between many of them there was at least to some extent a real diversity of interests liable to be exaggerated through sinister designs they differed in size in population in wealth and in actual and prospective resources and power they varied in the character of their industry and staple productions and in some existed domestic institutions which unwisely disturbed might endanger the harmony of the whole most carefully were all these circumstances weighed and the foundations of the new government laid upon principles of reciprocal concession and equitable compromise the jealousies which the smaller states might entertain of the power of the rest were allayed by a rule of representation confessedly unequal at the time and designed forever to remain so a natural fear that the broad scope of general legislation might bear upon and unwisely control particular interests was counteracted by limits strictly drawn around the action of the federal authority and to the people and the states was left unimpaired their sovereign power over the innumerable subjects embraced in the internal government of a just republic excepting such only as necessarily appertain to the concerns of the whole confederacy or its intercourse as a united community with the other nations of the world" 	 1
"this provident forecast has been verified by time half a century teeming with extraordinary events and elsewhere producing astonishing results has passed along but on our institutions it has left no injurious mark from a small community we have risen to a people powerful in numbers and in strength but with our increase has gone hand in hand the progress of just principles the privileges civil and religious of the humblest individual are still sacredly protected at home and while the valor and fortitude of our people have removed far from us the slightest apprehension of foreign power they have not yet induced us in a single instance to forget what is right our commerce has been extended to the remotest nations the value and even nature of our productions have been greatly changed a wide difference has arisen in the relative wealth and resources of every portion of our country yet the spirit of mutual regard and of faithful adherence to existing compacts has continued to prevail in our councils and never long been absent from our conduct we have learned by experience a fruitful lesson  that an implicit and undeviating adherence to the principles on which we set out can carry us prosperously onward through all the conflicts of circumstances and vicissitudes inseparable from the lapse of years" 	 1
"the success that has thus attended our great experiment is in itself a sufficient cause for gratitude on account of the happiness it has actually conferred and the example it has unanswerably given but to me my fellow citizens looking forward to the fardistant future with ardent prayers and confiding hopes this retrospect presents a ground for still deeper delight it impresses on my mind a firm belief that the perpetuity of our institutions depends upon ourselves that if we maintain the principles on which they were established they are destined to confer their benefits on countless generations yet to come and that america will present to every friend of mankind the cheering proof that a popular government wisely formed is wanting in no element of endurance or strength fifty years ago its rapid failure was boldly predicted latent and uncontrollable causes of dissolution were supposed to exist even by the wise and good and not only did unfriendly or speculative theorists anticipate for us the fate of past republics but the fears of many an honest patriot overbalanced his sanguine hopes look back on these forebodings not hastily but reluctantly made and see how in every instance they have completely failed" 	 1
"an imperfect experience during the struggles of the revolution was supposed to warrant the belief that the people would not bear the taxation requisite to discharge an immense public debt already incurred and to pay the necessary expenses of the government the cost of two wars has been paid not only without a murmur but with unequaled alacrity no one is now left to doubt that every burden will be cheerfully borne that may be necessary to sustain our civil institutions or guard our honor or welfare indeed all experience has shown that the willingness of the people to contribute to these ends in cases of emergency has uniformly outrun the confidence of their representatives" 	 1
"in the early stages of the new government when all felt the imposing influence as they recognized the unequaled services of the first president it was a common sentiment that the great weight of his character could alone bind the discordant materials of our government together and save us from the violence of contending factions since his death nearly forty years are gone party exasperation has been often carried to its highest point the virtue and fortitude of the people have sometimes been greatly tried yet our system purified and enhanced in value by all it has encountered still preserves its spirit of free and fearless discussion blended with unimpaired fraternal feeling" 	 1
"the capacity of the people for selfgovernment and their willingness from a high sense of duty and without those exhibitions of coercive power so generally employed in other countries to submit to all needful restraints and exactions of municipal law have also been favorably exemplified in the history of the american states occasionally it is true the ardor of public sentiment outrunning the regular progress of the judicial tribunals or seeking to reach cases not denounced as criminal by the existing law has displayed itself in a manner calculated to give pain to the friends of free government and to encourage the hopes of those who wish for its overthrow these occurrences however have been far less frequent in our country than in any other of equal population on the globe and with the diffusion of intelligence it may well be hoped that they will constantly diminish in frequency and violence the generous patriotism and sound common sense of the great mass of our fellow citizens will assuredly in time produce this result for as every assumption of illegal power not only wounds the majesty of the law but furnishes a pretext for abridging the liberties of the people the latter have the most direct and permanent interest in preserving the landmarks of social order and maintaining on all occasions the inviolability of those constitutional and legal provisions which they themselves have made" 	 1
"in a supposed unfitness of our institutions for those hostile emergencies which no country can always avoid their friends found a fruitful source of apprehension their enemies of hope while they foresaw less promptness of action than in governments differently formed they overlooked the far more important consideration that with us war could never be the result of individual or irresponsible will but must be a measure of redress for injuries sustained voluntarily resorted to by those who were to bear the necessary sacrifice who would consequently feel an individual interest in the contest and whose energy would be commensurate with the difficulties to be encountered actual events have proved their error the last war far from impairing gave new confidence to our government and amid recent apprehensions of a similar conflict we saw that the energies of our country would not be wanting in ample season to vindicate its rights we may not possess as we should not desire to possess the extended and everready military organization of other nations we may occasionally suffer in the outset for the want of it but among ourselves all doubt upon this great point has ceased while a salutary experience will prevent a contrary opinion from inviting aggression from abroad" 	 1
"certain danger was foretold from the extension of our territory the multiplication of states and the increase of population our system was supposed to be adapted only to boundaries comparatively narrow these have been widened beyond conjecture the members of our confederacy are already doubled and the numbers of our people are incredibly augmented the alleged causes of danger have long surpassed anticipation but none of the consequences have followed the power and influence of the republic have arisen to a height obvious to all mankind respect for its authority was not more apparent at its ancient than it is at its present limits new and inexhaustible sources of general prosperity have been opened the effects of distance have been averted by the inventive genius of our people developed and fostered by the spirit of our institutions and the enlarged variety and amount of interests productions and pursuits have strengthened the chain of mutual dependence and formed a circle of mutual benefits too apparent ever to be overlooked" 	 0
"in justly balancing the powers of the federal and state authorities difficulties nearly insurmountable arose at the outset and subsequent collisions were deemed inevitable amid these it was scarcely believed possible that a scheme of government so complex in construction could remain uninjured from time to time embarrassments have certainly occurred but how just is the confidence of future safety imparted by the knowledge that each in succession has been happily removed overlooking partial and temporary evils as inseparable from the practical operation of all human institutions and looking only to the general result every patriot has reason to be satisfied while the federal government has successfully performed its appropriate functions in relation to foreign affairs and concerns evidently national that of every state has remarkably improved in protecting and developing local interests and individual welfare and if the vibrations of authority have occasionally tended too much toward one or the other it is unquestionably certain that the ultimate operation of the entire system has been to strengthen all the existing institutions and to elevate our whole country in prosperity and renown" 	 0
"the last perhaps the greatest of the prominent sources of discord and disaster supposed to lurk in our political condition was the institution of domestic slavery our forefathers were deeply impressed with the delicacy of this subject and they treated it with a forbearance so evidently wise that in spite of every sinister foreboding it never until the present period disturbed the tranquillity of our common country such a result is sufficient evidence of the justice and the patriotism of their course it is evidence not to be mistaken that an adherence to it can prevent all embarrassment from this as well as from every other anticipated cause of difficulty or danger have not recent events made it obvious to the slightest reflection that the least deviation from this spirit of forbearance is injurious to every interest that of humanity included amidst the violence of excited passions this generous and fraternal feeling has been sometimes disregarded and standing as i now do before my countrymen in this high place of honor and of trust i can not refrain from anxiously invoking my fellow citizens never to be deaf to its dictates perceiving before my election the deep interest this subject was beginning to excite i believed it a solemn duty fully to make known my sentiments in regard to it and now when every motive for misrepresentation has passed away i trust that they will be candidly weighed and understood at least they will be my standard of conduct in the path before me i then declared that if the desire of those of my countrymen who were favorable to my election was gratified i must go into the presidential chair the inflexible and uncompromising opponent of every attempt on the part of congress to abolish slavery in the district of columbia against the wishes of the slaveholding states and also with a determination equally decided to resist the slightest interference with it in the states where it exists i submitted also to my fellow citizens with fullness and frankness the reasons which led me to this determination the result authorizes me to believe that they have been approved and are confided in by a majority of the people of the united states including those whom they most immediately affect it now only remains to add that no bill conflicting with these views can ever receive my constitutional sanction these opinions have been adopted in the firm belief that they are in accordance with the spirit that actuated the venerated fathers of the republic and that succeeding experience has proved them to be humane patriotic expedient honorable and just if the agitation of this subject was intended to reach the stability of our institutions enough has occurred to show that it has signally failed and that in this as in every other instance the apprehensions of the timid and the hopes of the wicked for the destruction of our government are again destined to be disappointed here and there indeed scenes of dangerous excitement have occurred terrifying instances of local violence have been witnessed and a reckless disregard of the consequences of their conduct has exposed individuals to popular indignation but neither masses of the people nor sections of the country have been swerved from their devotion to the bond of union and the principles it has made sacred it will be ever thus such attempts at dangerous agitation may periodically return but with each the object will be better understood that predominating affection for our political system which prevails throughout our territorial limits that calm and enlightened judgment which ultimately governs our people as one vast body will always be at hand to resist and control every effort foreign or domestic which aims or would lead to overthrow our institutions" 	 1
"what can be more gratifying than such a retrospect as this we look back on obstacles avoided and dangers overcome on expectations more than realized and prosperity perfectly secured to the hopes of the hostile the fears of the timid and the doubts of the anxious actual experience has given the conclusive reply we have seen time gradually dispel every unfavorable foreboding and our constitution surmount every adverse circumstance dreaded at the outset as beyond control present excitement will at all times magnify present dangers but true philosophy must teach us that none more threatening than the past can remain to be overcome and we ought for we have just reason to entertain an abiding confidence in the stability of our institutions and an entire conviction that if administered in the true form character and spirit in which they were established they are abundantly adequate to preserve to us and our children the rich blessings already derived from them to make our beloved land for a thousand generations that chosen spot where happiness springs from a perfect equality of political rights" 	 1
"for myself therefore i desire to declare that the principle that will govern me in the high duty to which my country calls me is a strict adherence to the letter and spirit of the constitution as it was designed by those who framed it looking back to it as a sacred instrument carefully and not easily framed remembering that it was throughout a work of concession and compromise viewing it as limited to national objects regarding it as leaving to the people and the states all power not explicitly parted with i shall endeavor to preserve protect and defend it by anxiously referring to its provision for direction in every action to matters of domestic concernment which it has intrusted to the federal government and to such as relate to our intercourse with foreign nations i shall zealously devote myself beyond those limits i shall never pass" 	 0
"to enter on this occasion into a further or more minute exposition of my views on the various questions of domestic policy would be as obtrusive as it is probably unexpected before the suffrages of my countrymen were conferred upon me i submitted to them with great precision my opinions on all the most prominent of these subjects those opinions i shall endeavor to carry out with my utmost ability" 	 0
"our course of foreign policy has been so uniform and intelligible as to constitute a rule of executive conduct which leaves little to my discretion unless indeed i were willing to run counter to the lights of experience and the known opinions of my constituents we sedulously cultivate the friendship of all nations as the conditions most compatible with our welfare and the principles of our government we decline alliances as adverse to our peace we desire commercial relations on equal terms being ever willing to give a fair equivalent for advantages received we endeavor to conduct our intercourse with openness and sincerity promptly avowing our objects and seeking to establish that mutual frankness which is as beneficial in the dealings of nations as of men we have no disposition and we disclaim all right to meddle in disputes whether internal or foreign that may molest other countries regarding them in their actual state as social communities and preserving a strict neutrality in all their controversies well knowing the tried valor of our people and our exhaustless resources we neither anticipate nor fear any designed aggression and in the consciousness of our own just conduct we feel a security that we shall never be called upon to exert our determination never to permit an invasion of our rights without punishment or redress" 	 0
"in approaching then in the presence of my assembled countrymen to make the solemn promise that yet remains and to pledge myself that i will faithfully execute the office i am about to fill i bring with me a settled purpose to maintain the institutions of my country which i trust will atone for the errors i commit" 	 0
"in receiving from the people the sacred trust twice confided to my illustrious predecessor and which he has discharged so faithfully and so well i know that i can not expect to perform the arduous task with equal ability and success but united as i have been in his counsels a daily witness of his exclusive and unsurpassed devotion to his countrys welfare agreeing with him in sentiments which his countrymen have warmly supported and permitted to partake largely of his confidence i may hope that somewhat of the same cheering approbation will be found to attend upon my path for him i but express with my own the wishes of all that he may yet long live to enjoy the brilliant evening of his wellspent life and for myself conscious of but one desire faithfully to serve my country i throw myself without fear on its justice and its kindness beyond that i only look to the gracious protection of the divine being whose strengthening support i humbly solicit and whom i fervently pray to look down upon us all may it be among the dispensations of his providence to bless our beloved country with honors and with length of days may her ways be ways of pleasantness and all her paths be peacecalled from a retirement which i had supposed was to continue for the residue of my life to fill the chief executive office of this great and free nation i appear before you fellowcitizens to take the oaths which the constitution prescribes as a necessary qualification for the performance of its duties and in obedience to a custom coeval with our government and what i believe to be your expectations i proceed to present to you a summary of the principles which will govern me in the discharge of the duties which i shall be called upon to perform" 	 0
"it was the remark of a roman consul in an early period of that celebrated republic that a most striking contrast was observable in the conduct of candidates for offices of power and trust before and after obtaining them they seldom carrying out in the latter case the pledges and promises made in the former however much the world may have improved in many respects in the lapse of upward of two thousand years since the remark was made by the virtuous and indignant roman i fear that a strict examination of the annals of some of the modern elective governments would develop similar instances of violated confidence" 	 1
"although the fiat of the people has gone forth proclaiming me the chief magistrate of this glorious union nothing upon their part remaining to be done it may be thought that a motive may exist to keep up the delusion under which they may be supposed to have acted in relation to my principles and opinions and perhaps there may be some in this assembly who have come here either prepared to condemn those i shall now deliver or approving them to doubt the sincerity with which they are now uttered but the lapse of a few months will confirm or dispel their fears the outline of principles to govern and measures to be adopted by an administration not yet begun will soon be exchanged for immutable history and i shall stand either exonerated by my countrymen or classed with the mass of those who promised that they might deceive and flattered with the intention to betray however strong may be my present purpose to realize the expectations of a magnanimous and confiding people i too well understand the dangerous temptations to which i shall be exposed from the magnitude of the power which it has been the pleasure of the people to commit to my hands not to place my chief confidence upon the aid of that almighty power which has hitherto protected me and enabled me to bring to favorable issues other important but still greatly inferior trusts heretofore confided to me by my country" 	 0
"the broad foundation upon which our constitution rests being the peoplea breath of theirs having made as a breath can unmake change or modify itit can be assigned to none of the great divisions of government but to that of democracy if such is its theory those who are called upon to administer it must recognize as its leading principle the duty of shaping their measures so as to produce the greatest good to the greatest number but with these broad admissions if we would compare the sovereignty acknowledged to exist in the mass of our people with the power claimed by other sovereignties even by those which have been considered most purely democratic we shall find a most essential difference all others lay claim to power limited only by their own will the majority of our citizens on the contrary possess a sovereignty with an amount of power precisely equal to that which has been granted to them by the parties to the national compact and nothing beyond we admit of no government by divine right believing that so far as power is concerned the beneficent creator has made no distinction amongst men that all are upon an equality and that the only legitimate right to govern is an express grant of power from the governed the constitution of the united states is the instrument containing this grant of power to the several departments composing the government on an examination of that instrument it will be found to contain declarations of power granted and of power withheld the latter is also susceptible of division into power which the majority had the right to grant but which they do not think proper to intrust to their agents and that which they could not have granted not being possessed by themselves in other words there are certain rights possessed by each individual american citizen which in his compact with the others he has never surrendered some of them indeed he is unable to surrender being in the language of our system unalienable the boasted privilege of a roman citizen was to him a shield only against a petty provincial ruler whilst the proud democrat of athens would console himself under a sentence of death for a supposed violation of the national faithwhich no one understood and which at times was the subject of the mockery of allor the banishment from his home his family and his country with or without an alleged cause that it was the act not of a single tyrant or hated aristocracy but of his assembled countrymen far different is the power of our sovereignty it can interfere with no ones faith prescribe forms of worship for no ones observance inflict no punishment but after wellascertained guilt the result of investigation under rules prescribed by the constitution itself these precious privileges and those scarcely less important of giving expression to his thoughts and opinions either by writing or speaking unrestrained but by the liability for injury to others and that of a full participation in all the advantages which flow from the government the acknowledged property of all the american citizen derives from no charter granted by his fellowman he claims them because he is himself a man fashioned by the same almighty hand as the rest of his species and entitled to a full share of the blessings with which he has endowed them notwithstanding the limited sovereignty possessed by the people of the united stages and the restricted grant of power to the government which they have adopted enough has been given to accomplish all the objects for which it was created it has been found powerful in war and hitherto justice has been administered and intimate union effected domestic tranquillity preserved and personal liberty secured to the citizen as was to be expected however from the defect of language and the necessarily sententious manner in which the constitution is written disputes have arisen as to the amount of power which it has actually granted or was intended to grant" 	 1
"this is more particularly the case in relation to that part of the instrument which treats of the legislative branch and not only as regards the exercise of powers claimed under a general clause giving that body the authority to pass all laws necessary to carry into effect the specified powers but in relation to the latter also it is however consolatory to reflect that most of the instances of alleged departure from the letter or spirit of the constitution have ultimately received the sanction of a majority of the people and the fact that many of our statesmen most distinguished for talent and patriotism have been at one time or other of their political career on both sides of each of the most warmly disputed questions forces upon us the inference that the errors if errors there were are attributable to the intrinsic difficulty in many instances of ascertaining the intentions of the framers of the constitution rather than the influence of any sinister or unpatriotic motive but the great danger to our institutions does not appear to me to be in a usurpation by the government of power not granted by the people but by the accumulation in one of the departments of that which was assigned to others limited as are the powers which have been granted still enough have been granted to constitute a despotism if concentrated in one of the departments this danger is greatly heightened as it has been always observable that men are less jealous of encroachments of one department upon another than upon their own reserved rights when the constitution of the united states first came from the hands of the convention which formed it many of the sternest republicans of the day were alarmed at the extent of the power which had been granted to the federal government and more particularly of that portion which had been assigned to the executive branch there were in it features which appeared not to be in harmony with their ideas of a simple representative democracy or republic and knowing the tendency of power to increase itself particularly when exercised by a single individual predictions were made that at no very remote period the government would terminate in virtual monarchy it would not become me to say that the fears of these patriots have been already realized but as i sincerely believe that the tendency of measures and of mens opinions for some years past has been in that direction it is i conceive strictly proper that i should take this occasion to repeat the assurances i have heretofore given of my determination to arrest the progress of that tendency if it really exists and restore the government to its pristine health and vigor as far as this can be effected by any legitimate exercise of the power placed in my hands" 	 0
"i proceed to state in as summary a manner as i can my opinion of the sources of the evils which have been so extensively complained of and the correctives which may be applied some of the former are unquestionably to be found in the defects of the constitution others in my judgment are attributable to a misconstruction of some of its provisions of the former is the eligibility of the same individual to a second term of the presidency the sagacious mind of mr jefferson early saw and lamented this error and attempts have been made hitherto without success to apply the amendatory power of the states to its correction as however one mode of correction is in the power of every president and consequently in mine it would be useless and perhaps invidious to enumerate the evils of which in the opinion of many of our fellowcitizens this error of the sages who framed the constitution may have been the source and the bitter fruits which we are still to gather from it if it continues to disfigure our system it may be observed however as a general remark that republics can commit no greater error than to adopt or continue any feature in their systems of government which may be calculated to create or increase the lover of power in the bosoms of those to whom necessity obliges them to commit the management of their affairs and surely nothing is more likely to produce such a state of mind than the long continuance of an office of high trust nothing can be more corrupting nothing more destructive of all those noble feelings which belong to the character of a devoted republican patriot when this corrupting passion once takes possession of the human mind like the love of gold it becomes insatiable it is the neverdying worm in his bosom grows with his growth and strengthens with the declining years of its victim if this is true it is the part of wisdom for a republic to limit the service of that officer at least to whom she has intrusted the management of her foreign relations the execution of her laws and the command of her armies and navies to a period so short as to prevent his forgetting that he is the accountable agent not the principal the servant not the master until an amendment of the constitution can be effected public opinion may secure the desired object i give my aid to it by renewing the pledge heretofore given that under no circumstances will i consent to serve a second term" 	 1
"but if there is danger to public liberty from the acknowledged defects of the constitution in the want of limit to the continuance of the executive power in the same hands there is i apprehend not much less from a misconstruction of that instrument as it regards the powers actually given i can not conceive that by a fair construction any or either of its provisions would be found to constitute the president a part of the legislative power it can not be claimed from the power to recommend since although enjoined as a duty upon him it is a privilege which he holds in common with every other citizen and although there may be something more of confidence in the propriety of the measures recommended in the one case than in the other in the obligations of ultimate decision there can be no difference in the language of the constitution all the legislative powers which it grants are vested in the congress of the united states it would be a solecism in language to say that any portion of these is not included in the whole" 	 1
"it may be said indeed that the constitution has given to the executive the power to annul the acts of the legislative body by refusing to them his assent so a similar power has necessarily resulted from that instrument to the judiciary and yet the judiciary forms no part of the legislature there is it is true this difference between these grants of power the executive can put his negative upon the acts of the legislature for other cause than that of want of conformity to the constitution whilst the judiciary can only declare void those which violate that instrument but the decision of the judiciary is final in such a case whereas in every instance where the veto of the executive is applied it may be overcome by a vote of twothirds of both houses of congress the negative upon the acts of the legislative by the executive authority and that in the hands of one individual would seem to be an incongruity in our system like some others of a similar character however it appears to be highly expedient and if used only with the forbearance and in the spirit which was intended by its authors it may be productive of great good and be found one of the best safeguards to the union at the period of the formation of the constitution the principle does not appear to have enjoyed much favor in the state governments it existed but in two and in one of these there was a plural executive if we would search for the motives which operated upon the purely patriotic and enlightened assembly which framed the constitution for the adoption of a provision so apparently repugnant to the leading democratic principle that the majority should govern we must reject the idea that they anticipated from it any benefit to the ordinary course of legislation they knew too well the high degree of intelligence which existed among the people and the enlightened character of the state legislatures not to have the fullest confidence that the two bodies elected by them would be worthy representatives of such constituents and of course that they would require no aid in conceiving and maturing the measures which the circumstances of the country might require and it is preposterous to suppose that a thought could for a moment have been entertained that the president placed at the capital in the center of the country could better understand the wants and wishes of the people than their own immediate representatives who spend a part of every year among them living with them often laboring with them and bound to them by the triple tie of interest duty and affection to assist or control congress then in its ordinary legislation could not i conceive have been the motive for conferring the veto power on the president this argument acquires additional force from the fact of its never having been thus used by the first six presidentsand two of them were members of the convention one presiding over its deliberations and the other bearing a larger share in consummating the labors of that august body than any other person but if bills were never returned to congress by either of the presidents above referred to upon the ground of their being inexpedient or not as well adapted as they might be to the wants of the people the veto was applied upon that of want of conformity to the constitution or because errors had been committed from a too hasty enactment" 	 1
"there is another ground for the adoption of the veto principle which had probably more influence in recommending it to the convention than any other i refer to the security which it gives to the just and equitable action of the legislature upon all parts of the union it could not but have occurred to the convention that in a country so extensive embracing so great a variety of soil and climate and consequently of products and which from the same causes must ever exhibit a great difference in the amount of the population of its various sections calling for a great diversity in the employments of the people that the legislation of the majority might not always justly regard the rights and interests of the minority and that acts of this character might be passed under an express grant by the words of the constitution and therefore not within the competency of the judiciary to declare void that however enlightened and patriotic they might suppose from past experience the members of congress might be and however largely partaking in the general of the liberal feelings of the people it was impossible to expect that bodies so constituted should not sometimes be controlled by local interests and sectional feelings it was proper therefore to provide some umpire from whose situation and mode of appointment more independence and freedom from such influences might be expected such a one was afforded by the executive department constituted by the constitution a person elected to that high office having his constituents in every section state and subdivision of the union must consider himself bound by the most solemn sanctions to guard protect and defend the rights of all and of every portion great or small from the injustice and oppression of the rest i consider the veto power therefore given by the constitution to the executive of the united states solely as a conservative power to be used only first to protect the constitution from violation secondly the people from the effects of hasty legislation where their will has been probably disregarded or not well understood and thirdly to prevent the effects of combinations violative of the rights of minorities in reference to the second of these objects i may observe that i consider it the right and privilege of the people to decide disputed points of the constitution arising from the general grant of power to congress to carry into effect the powers expressly given and i believe with mr madison that repeated recognitions under varied circumstances in acts of the legislative executive and judicial branches of the government accompanied by indications in different modes of the concurrence of the general will of the nation as affording to the president sufficient authority for his considering such disputed points as settled" 	 0
"upward of half a century has elapsed since the adoption of the present form of government it would be an object more highly desirable than the gratification of the curiosity of speculative statesmen if its precise situation could be ascertained a fair exhibit made of the operations of each of its departments of the powers which they respectively claim and exercise of the collisions which have occurred between them or between the whole government and those of the states or either of them we could then compare our actual condition after fifty years trial of our system with what it was in the commencement of its operations and ascertain whether the predictions of the patriots who opposed its adoption or the confident hopes of its advocates have been best realized the great dread of the former seems to have been that the reserved powers of the states would be absorbed by those of the federal government and a consolidated power established leaving to the states the shadow only of that independent action for which they had so zealously contended and on the preservation of which they relied as the last hope of liberty without denying that the result to which they looked with so much apprehension is in the way of being realized it is obvious that they did not clearly see the mode of its accomplishment the general government has seized upon none of the reserved rights of the states as far as any open warfare may have gone the state authorities have amply maintained their rights to a casual observer our system presents no appearance of discord between the different members which compose it even the addition of many new ones has produced no jarring they move in their respective orbits in perfect harmony with the central head and with each other but there is still an undercurrent at work by which if not seasonably checked the worst apprehensions of our antifederal patriots will be realized and not only will the state authorities be overshadowed by the great increase of power in the executive department of the general government but the character of that government if not its designation be essentially and radically changed this state of things has been in part effected by causes inherent in the constitution and in part by the neverfailing tendency of political power to increase itself by making the president the sole distributer of all the patronage of the government the framers of the constitution do not appear to have anticipated at how short a period it would become a formidable instrument to control the free operations of the state governments of trifling importance at first it had early in mr jeffersons administration become so powerful as to create great alarm in the mind of that patriot from the potent influence it might exert in controlling the freedom of the elective franchise if such could have then been the effects of its influence how much greater must be the danger at this time quadrupled in amount as it certainly is and more completely under the control of the executive will than their construction of their powers allowed or the forbearing characters of all the early presidents permitted them to make but it is not by the extent of its patronage alone that the executive department has become dangerous but by the use which it appears may be made of the appointing power to bring under its control the whole revenues of the country the constitution has declared it to be the duty of the president to see that the laws are executed and it makes him the commander in chief of the armies and navy of the united states if the opinion of the most approved writers upon that species of mixed government which in modern europe is termed monarchy in contradistinction to despotism is correct there was wanting no other addition to the powers of our chief magistrate to stamp a monarchical character on our government but the control of the public finances and to me it appears strange indeed that anyone should doubt that the entire control which the president possesses over the officers who have the custody of the public money by the power of removal with or without cause does for all mischievous purposes at least virtually subject the treasure also to his disposal the first roman emperor in his attempt to seize the sacred treasure silenced the opposition of the officer to whose charge it had been committed by a significant allusion to his sword by a selection of political instruments for the care of the public money a reference to their commissions by a president would be quite as effectual an argument as that of caesar to the roman knight i am not insensible of the great difficulty that exists in drawing a proper plan for the safe keeping and disbursement of the public revenues and i know the importance which has been attached by men of great abilities and patriotism to the divorce as it is called of the treasury from the banking institutions it is not the divorce which is complained of but the unhallowed union of the treasury with the executive department which has created such extensive alarm to this danger to our republican institutions and that created by the influence given to the executive through the instrumentality of the federal officers i propose to apply all the remedies which may be at my command it was certainly a great error in the framers of the constitution not to have made the officer at the head of the treasury department entirely independent of the executive he should at least have been removable only upon the demand of the popular branch of the legislature i have determined never to remove a secretary of the treasury without communicating all the circumstances attending such removal to both houses of congress" 	 1
"the influence of the executive in controlling the freedom of the elective franchise through the medium of the public officers can be effectually checked by renewing the prohibition published by mr jefferson forbidding their interference in elections further than giving their own votes and their own independence secured by an assurance of perfect immunity in exercising this sacred privilege of freemen under the dictates of their own unbiased judgments never with my consent shall an officer of the people compensated for his services out of their pockets become the pliant instrument of executive will" 	 1
"there is no part of the means placed in the hands of the executive which might be used with greater effect for unhallowed purposes than the control of the public press the maxim which our ancestors derived from the mother country that the freedom of the press is the great bulwark of civil and religious liberty is one of the most precious legacies which they have left us we have learned too from our own as well as the experience of other countries that golden shackles by whomsoever or by whatever pretense imposed are as fatal to it as the iron bonds of despotism the presses in the necessary employment of the government should never be used to clear the guilty or to varnish crime a decent and manly examination of the acts of the government should be not only tolerated but encouraged" 	 1
"upon another occasion i have given my opinion at some length upon the impropriety of executive interference in the legislation of congressthat the article in the constitution making it the duty of the president to communicate information and authorizing him to recommend measures was not intended to make him the source in legislation and in particular that he should never be looked to for schemes of finance it would be very strange indeed that the constitution should have strictly forbidden one branch of the legislature from interfering in the origination of such bills and that it should be considered proper that an altogether different department of the government should be permitted to do so some of our best political maxims and opinions have been drawn from our parent isle there are others however which can not be introduced in our system without singular incongruity and the production of much mischief and this i conceive to be one no matter in which of the houses of parliament a bill may originate nor by whom introduceda minister or a member of the opposition by the fiction of law or rather of constitutional principle the sovereign is supposed to have prepared it agreeably to his will and then submitted it to parliament for their advice and consent now the very reverse is the case here not only with regard to the principle but the forms prescribed by the constitution the principle certainly assigns to the only body constituted by the constitution the legislative body the power to make laws and the forms even direct that the enactment should be ascribed to them the senate in relation to revenue bills have the right to propose amendments and so has the executive by the power given him to return them to the house of representatives with his objections it is in his power also to propose amendments in the existing revenue laws suggested by his observations upon their defective or injurious operation but the delicate duty of devising schemes of revenue should be left where the constitution has placed itwith the immediate representatives of the people for similar reasons the mode of keeping the public treasure should be prescribed by them and the further removed it may be from the control of the executive the more wholesome the arrangement and the more in accordance with republican principle" 	 0
"connected with this subject is the character of the currency the idea of making it exclusively metallic however well intended appears to me to be fraught with more fatal consequences than any other scheme having no relation to the personal rights of the citizens that has ever been devised if any single scheme could produce the effect of arresting at once that mutation of condition by which thousands of our most indigent fellowcitizens by their industry and enterprise are raised to the possession of wealth that is the one if there is one measure better calculated than another to produce that state of things so much deprecated by all true republicans by which the rich are daily adding to their hoards and the poor sinking deeper into penury it is an exclusive metallic currency or if there is a process by which the character of the country for generosity and nobleness of feeling may be destroyed by the great increase and neck toleration of usury it is an exclusive metallic currency" 	 1
"amongst the other duties of a delicate character which the president is called upon to perform is the supervision of the government of the territories of the united states those of them which are destined to become members of our great political family are compensated by their rapid progress from infancy to manhood for the partial and temporary deprivation of their political rights it is in this district only where american citizens are to be found who under a settled policy are deprived of many important political privileges without any inspiring hope as to the future their only consolation under circumstances of such deprivation is that of the devoted exterior guards of a campthat their sufferings secure tranquillity and safety within are there any of their countrymen who would subject them to greater sacrifices to any other humiliations than those essentially necessary to the security of the object for which they were thus separated from their fellowcitizens are their rights alone not to be guaranteed by the application of those great principles upon which all our constitutions are founded we are told by the greatest of british orators and statesmen that at the commencement of the war of the revolution the most stupid men in england spoke of their american subjects are there indeed citizens of any of our states who have dreamed of their subjects in the district of columbia such dreams can never be realized by any agency of mine the people of the district of columbia are not the subjects of the people of the states but free american citizens being in the latter condition when the constitution was formed no words used in that instrument could have been intended to deprive them of that character if there is anything in the great principle of unalienable rights so emphatically insisted upon in our declaration of independence they could neither make nor the united states accept a surrender of their liberties and become the subjectsin other words the slavesof their former fellowcitizens if this be trueand it will scarcely be denied by anyone who has a correct idea of his own rights as an american citizenthe grant to congress of exclusive jurisdiction in the district of columbia can be interpreted so far as respects the aggregate people of the united states as meaning nothing more than to allow to congress the controlling power necessary to afford a free and safe exercise of the functions assigned to the general government by the constitution in all other respects the legislation of congress should be adapted to their peculiar position and wants and be conformable with their deliberate opinions of their own interests" 	 0
"i have spoken of the necessity of keeping the respective departments of the government as well as all the other authorities of our country within their appropriate orbits this is a matter of difficulty in some cases as the powers which they respectively claim are often not defined by any distinct lines mischievous however in their tendencies as collisions of this kind may be those which arise between the respective communities which for certain purposes compose one nation are much more so for no such nation can long exist without the careful culture of those feelings of confidence and affection which are the effective bonds to union between free and confederated states strong as is the tie of interest it has been often found ineffectual men blinded by their passions have been known to adopt measures for their country in direct opposition to all the suggestions of policy the alternative then is to destroy or keep down a bad passion by creating and fostering a good one and this seems to be the corner stone upon which our american political architects have reared the fabric of our government the cement which was to bind it and perpetuate its existence was the affectionate attachment between all its members to insure the continuance of this feeling produced at first by a community of dangers of sufferings and of interests the advantages of each were made accessible to all no participation in any good possessed by any member of our extensive confederacy except in domestic government was withheld from the citizen of any other member by a process attended with no difficulty no delay no expense but that of removal the citizen of one might become the citizen of any other and successively of the whole the lines too separating powers to be exercised by the citizens of one state from those of another seem to be so distinctly drawn as to leave no room for misunderstanding the citizens of each state unite in their persons all the privileges which that character confers and all that they may claim as citizens of the united states but in no case can the same persons at the same time act as the citizen of two separate states and he is therefore positively precluded from any interference with the reserved powers of any state but that of which he is for the time being a citizen he may indeed offer to the citizens of other states his advice as to their management and the form in which it is tendered is left to his own discretion and sense of propriety it may be observed however that organized associations of citizens requiring compliance with their wishes too much resemble the recommendations of athens to her allies supported by an armed and powerful fleet it was indeed to the ambition of the leading states of greece to control the domestic concerns of the others that the destruction of that celebrated confederacy and subsequently of all its members is mainly to be attributed and it is owing to the absence of that spirit that the helvetic confederacy has for so many years been preserved never has there been seen in the institutions of the separate members of any confederacy more elements of discord in the principles and forms of government and religion as well as in the circumstances of the several cantons so marked a discrepancy was observable as to promise anything but harmony in their intercourse or permanency in their alliance and yet for ages neither has been interrupted content with the positive benefits which their union produced with the independence and safety from foreign aggression which it secured these sagacious people respected the institutions of each other however repugnant to their own principles and prejudices" 	 1
"our confederacy fellowcitizens can only be preserved by the same forbearance our citizens must be content with the exercise of the powers with which the constitution clothes them the attempt of those of one state to control the domestic institutions of another can only result in feelings of distrust and jealousy the certain harbingers of disunion violence and civil war and the ultimate destruction of our free institutions our confederacy is perfectly illustrated by the terms and principles governing a common copartnership there is a fund of power to be exercised under the direction of the joint councils of the allied members but that which has been reserved by the individual members is intangible by the common government or the individual members composing it to attempt it finds no support in the principles of our constitution" 	 1
"it should be our constant and earnest endeavor mutually to cultivate a spirit of concord and harmony among the various parts of our confederacy experience has abundantly taught us that the agitation by citizens of one part of the union of a subject not confided to the general government but exclusively under the guardianship of the local authorities is productive of no other consequences than bitterness alienation discord and injury to the very cause which is intended to be advanced of all the great interests which appertain to our country that of unioncordial confiding fraternal unionis by far the most important since it is the only true and sure guaranty of all others" 	 1
"in consequence of the embarrassed state of business and the currency some of the states may meet with difficulty in their financial concerns however deeply we may regret anything imprudent or excessive in the engagements into which states have entered for purposes of their own it does not become us to disparage the states governments nor to discourage them from making proper efforts for their own relief on the contrary it is our duty to encourage them to the extent of our constitutional authority to apply their best means and cheerfully to make all necessary sacrifices and submit to all necessary burdens to fulfill their engagements and maintain their credit for the character and credit of the several states form a part of the character and credit of the whole country the resources of the country are abundant the enterprise and activity of our people proverbial and we may well hope that wise legislation and prudent administration by the respective governments each acting within its own sphere will restore former prosperity" 	 0
"unpleasant and even dangerous as collisions may sometimes be between the constituted authorities of the citizens of our country in relation to the lines which separate their respective jurisdictions the results can be of no vital injury to our institutions if that ardent patriotism that devoted attachment to liberty that spirit of moderation and forbearance for which our countrymen were once distinguished continue to be cherished if this continues to be the ruling passion of our souls the weaker feeling of the mistaken enthusiast will be corrected the utopian dreams of the scheming politician dissipated and the complicated intrigues of the demagogue rendered harmless the spirit of liberty is the sovereign balm for every injury which our institutions may receive on the contrary no care that can be used in the construction of our government no division of powers no distribution of checks in its several departments will prove effectual to keep us a free people if this spirit is suffered to decay and decay it will without constant nurture to the neglect of this duty the best historians agree in attributing the ruin of all the republics with whose existence and fall their writings have made us acquainted the same causes will ever produce the same effects and as long as the love of power is a dominant passion of the human bosom and as long as the understandings of men can be warped and their affections changed by operations upon their passions and prejudices so long will the liberties of a people depend on their own constant attention to its preservation the danger to all wellestablished free governments arises from the unwillingness of the people to believe in its existence or from the influence of designing men diverting their attention from the quarter whence it approaches to a source from which it can never come this is the old trick of those who would usurp the government of their country in the name of democracy they speak warning the people against the influence of wealth and the danger of aristocracy history ancient and modern is full of such examples caesar became the master of the roman people and the senate under the pretense of supporting the democratic claims of the former against the aristocracy of the latter cromwell in the character of protector of the liberties of the people became the dictator of england and bolivar possessed himself of unlimited power with the title of his countrys liberator there is on the contrary no instance on record of an extensive and well established republic being changed into an aristocracy the tendencies of all such governments in their decline is to monarchy and the antagonist principle to liberty there is the spirit of factiona spirit which assumes the character and in times of great excitement imposes itself upon the people as the genuine spirit of freedom and like the false christs whose coming was foretold by the savior seeks to and were it possible would impose upon the true and most faithful disciples of liberty it is in periods like this that it behooves the people to be most watchful of those to whom they have intrusted power and although there is at times much difficulty in distinguishing the false from the true spirit a calm and dispassionate investigation will detect the counterfeit as well by the character of its operations as the results that are produced the true spirit of liberty although devoted persevering bold and uncompromising in principle that secured is mild and tolerant and scrupulous as to the means it employs whilst the spirit of party assuming to be that of liberty is harsh vindictive and intolerant and totally reckless as to the character of the allies which it brings to the aid of its cause when the genuine spirit of liberty animates the body of a people to a thorough examination of their affairs it leads to the excision of every excrescence which may have fastened itself upon any of the departments of the government and restores the system to its pristine health and beauty but the reign of an intolerant spirit of party amongst a free people seldom fails to result in a dangerous accession to the executive power introduced and established amidst unusual professions of devotion to democracy" 	 0

"this most admirable and wisest system of wellregulated selfgovernment among men ever devised by human minds has been tested by its successful operation for more than half a century and if preserved from the usurpations of the federal government on the one hand and the exercise by the states of powers not reserved to them on the other will i fervently hope and believe endure for ages to come and dispense the blessings of civil and religious liberty to distant generations to effect objects so dear to every patriot i shall devote myself with anxious solicitude it will be my desire to guard against that most fruitful source of danger to the harmonious action of our system which consists in substituting the mere discretion and caprice of the executive or of majorities in the legislative department of the government for powers which have been withheld from the federal government by the constitution by the theory of our government majorities rule but this right is not an arbitrary or unlimited one it is a right to be exercised in subordination to the constitution and in conformity to it one great object of the constitution was to restrain majorities from oppressing minorities or encroaching upon their just rights minorities have a right to appeal to the constitution as a shield against such oppression" 	 0
"that the blessings of liberty which our constitution secures may be enjoyed alike by minorities and majorities the executive has been wisely invested with a qualified veto upon the acts of the legislature it is a negative power and is conservative in its character it arrests for the time hasty inconsiderate or unconstitutional legislation invites reconsideration and transfers questions at issue between the legislative and executive departments to the tribunal of the people like all other powers it is subject to be abused when judiciously and properly exercised the constitution itself may be saved from infraction and the rights of all preserved and protected" 	 1
"the inestimable value of our federal union is felt and acknowledged by all by this system of united and confederated states our people are permitted collectively arid individually to seek their own happiness in their own way and the consequences have been most auspicious since the union was formed the number of the states has increased from thirteen to twentyeight two of these have taken their position as members of the confederacy within the last week our population has increased from three to twenty millions new communities and states are seeking protection under its aegis and multitudes from the old world are flocking to our shores to participate in its blessings beneath its benign sway peace and prosperity prevail freed from the burdens and miseries of war our trade and intercourse have extended throughout the world mind no longer tasked in devising means to accomplish or resist schemes of ambition usurpation or conquest is devoting itself to mans true interests in developing his faculties and powers and the capacity of nature to minister to his enjoyments genius is free to announce its inventions and discoveries and the hand is free to accomplish whatever the head conceives not incompatible with the rights of a fellowbeing all distinctions of birth or of rank have been abolished all citizens whether native or adopted are placed upon terms of precise equality all are entitled to equal rights and equal protection no union exists between church and state and perfect freedom of opinion is guaranteed to all sects and creeds" 	 1
"these are some of the blessings secured to our happy land by our federal union to perpetuate them it is our sacred duty to preserve it who shall assign limits to the achievements of free minds and free hands under the protection of this glorious union no treason to mankind since the organization of society would be equal in atrocity to that of him who would lift his hand to destroy it he would overthrow the noblest structure of human wisdom which protects himself and his fellowman he would stop the progress of free government and involve his country either in anarchy or despotism he would extinguish the fire of liberty which warms and animates the hearts of happy millions and invites all the nations of the earth to imitate our example if he say that error and wrong are committed in the administration of the government let him remember that nothing human can be perfect and that under no other system of government revealed by heaven or devised by man has reason been allowed so free and broad a scope to combat error has the sword of despots proved to be a safer or surer instrument of reform in government than enlightened reason does he expect to find among the ruins of this union a happier abode for our swarming millions than they now have under it every lover of his country must shudder at the thought of the possibility of its dissolution and will be ready to adopt the patriotic sentiment our federal union  it must be preserved to preserve it the compromises which alone enabled our fathers to form a common constitution for the government and protection of so many states and distinct communities of such diversified habits interests and domestic institutions must be sacredly and religiously observed any attempt to disturb or destroy these compromises being terms of the compact of union can lead to none other than the most ruinous and disastrous consequences" 	 0
"it is a source of deep regret that in some sections of our country misguided persons have occasionally indulged in schemes and agitations whose object is the destruction of domestic institutions existing in other sections  institutions which existed at the adoption of the constitution and were recognized and protected by it all must see that if it were possible for them to be successful in attaining their object the dissolution of the union and the consequent destruction of our happy form of government must speedily follow" 	 0
"i am happy to believe that at every period of our existence as a nation there has existed and continues to exist among the great mass of our people a devotion to the union of the states which will shield and protect it against the moral treason of any who would seriously contemplate its destruction to secure a continuance of that devotion the compromises of the constitution must not only be preserved but sectional jealousies and heartburnings must be discountenanced and all should remember that they are members of the same political family having a common destiny to increase the attachment of our people to the union our laws should be just any policy which shall tend to favor monopolies or the peculiar interests of sections or classes must operate to the prejudice of the interest of their fellow citizens and should be avoided if the compromises of the constitution be preserved if sectional jealousies and heartburnings be discountenanced if our laws be just and the government be practically administered strictly within the limits of power prescribed to it we may discard all apprehensions for the safety of the union" 	 0
"with these views of the nature character and objects of the government and the value of the union i shall steadily oppose the creation of those institutions and systems which in their nature tend to pervert it from its legitimate purposes and make it the instrument of sections classes and individuals we need no national banks or other extraneous institutions planted around the government to control or strengthen it in opposition to the will of its authors experience has taught us how unnecessary they are as auxiliaries of the public authorities  how impotent for good and how powerful for mischief" 	 1
"ours was intended to be a plain and frugal government and i shall regard it to be my duty to recommend to congress and as far as the executive is concerned to enforce by all the means within my power the strictest economy in the expenditure of the public money which may be compatible with the public interests" 	 1
"a national debt has become almost an institution of european monarchies it is viewed in some of them as an essential prop to existing governments melancholy is the condition of that people whose government can be sustained only by a system which periodically transfers large amounts from the labor of the many to the coffers of the few such a system is incompatible with the ends for which our republican government was instituted under a wise policy the debts contracted in our revolution and during the war of 1812 have been happily extinguished by a judicious application of the revenues not required for other necessary purposes it is not doubted that the debt which has grown out of the circumstances of the last few years may be speedily paid off" 	 0
"i congratulate my fellow citizens on the entire restoration of the credit of the general government of the union and that of many of the states happy would it be for the indebted states if they were freed from their liabilities many of which were incautiously contracted although the government of the union is neither in a legal nor a moral sense bound for the debts of the states and it would be a violation of our compact of union to assume them yet we can not but feel a deep interest in seeing all the states meet their public liabilities and pay off their just debts at the earliest practicable period that they will do so as soon as it can be done without imposing too heavy burdens on their citizens there is no reason to doubt the sound moral and honorable feeling of the people of the indebted states can not be questioned and we are happy to perceive a settled disposition on their part as their ability returns after a season of unexampled pecuniary embarrassment to pay off all just demands and to acquiesce in any reasonable measures to accomplish that object" 	 0
"one of the difficulties which we have had to encounter in the practical administration of the government consists in the adjustment of our revenue laws and the levy of the taxes necessary for the support of government in the general proposition that no more money shall be collected than the necessities of an economical administration shall require all parties seem to acquiesce nor does there seem to be any material difference of opinion as to the absence of right in the government to tax one section of country or one class of citizens or one occupation for the mere profit of another justice and sound policy forbid the federal government to foster one branch of industry to the detriment of another or to cherish the interests of one portion to the injury of another portion of our common country i have heretofore declared to my fellowcitizens that in my judgment it is the duty of the government to extend as far as it may be practicable to do so by its revenue laws and all other means within its power fair and just protection to all of the great interests of the whole union embracing agriculture manufactures the mechanic arts commerce and navigation i have also declared my opinion to be in favor of a tariff for revenue and that in adjusting the details of such a tariff i have sanctioned such moderate discriminating duties as would produce the amount of revenue needed and at the same time afford reasonable incidental protection to our home industry and that i was opposed to a tariff for protection merely and not for revenue" 	 1
"the power to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and excises was an indispensable one to be conferred on the federal government which without it would possess no means of providing for its own support in executing this power by levying a tariff of duties for the support of government the raising of revenue should be the object and protection the incident to reverse this principle and make protection the object and revenue the incident would be to inflict manifest injustice upon all other than the protected interests in levying duties for revenue it is doubtless proper to make such discriminations within the revenue principle as will afford incidental protection to our home interests within the revenue limit there is a discretion to discriminate beyond that limit the rightful exercise of the power is not conceded the incidental protection afforded to our home interests by discriminations within the revenue range it is believed will be ample in making discriminations all our home interests should as far as practicable be equally protected the largest portion of our people are agriculturists others are employed in manufactures commerce navigation and the mechanic arts they are all engaged in their respective pursuits and their joint labors constitute the national or home industry to tax one branch of this home industry for the benefit of another would be unjust no one of these interests can rightfully claim an advantage over the others or to be enriched by impoverishing the others all are equally entitled to the fostering care and protection of the government in exercising a sound discretion in levying discriminating duties within the limit prescribed care should be taken that it be done in a manner not to benefit the wealthy few at the expense of the toiling millions by taxing lowest the luxuries of life or articles of superior quality and high price which can only be consumed by the wealthy and highest the necessaries of life or articles of coarse quality and low price which the poor and great mass of our people must consume the burdens of government should as far as practicable be distributed justly and equally among all classes of our population these general views long entertained on this subject i have deemed it proper to reiterate it is a subject upon which conflicting interests of sections and occupations are supposed to exist and a spirit of mutual concession and compromise in adjusting its details should be cherished by every part of our widespread country as the only means of preserving harmony and a cheerful acquiescence of all in the operation of our revenue laws our patriotic citizens in every part of the union will readily submit to the payment of such taxes as shall be needed for the support of their government whether in peace or in war if they are so levied as to distribute the burdens as equally as possible among them" 	 0
"the republic of texas has made known her desire to come into our union to form a part of our confederacy and enjoy with us the blessings of liberty secured and guaranteed by our constitution texas was once a part of our country  was unwisely ceded away to a foreign power  is now independent and possesses an undoubted right to dispose of a part or the whole of her territory and to merge her sovereignty as a separate and independent state in ours i congratulate my country that by an act of the late congress of the united states the assent of this government has been given to the reunion and it only remains for the two countries to agree upon the terms to consummate an object so important to both" 	 0
"i regard the question of annexation as belonging exclusively to the united states and texas they are independent powers competent to contract and foreign nations have no right to interfere with them or to take exceptions to their reunion foreign powers do not seem to appreciate the true character of our government our union is confederation of independent states whose policy is peace with each other and all the world to enlarge its limits is to extend the dominions of peace over additional territories and increasing millions the world has nothing to fear from military ambition in our government while the chief magistrate and the popular branch of congress are elected for short terms by the suffrages of those millions who must in their own persons bear all the burdens and miseries of war our government can not be otherwise than pacific foreign powers should therefore look on the annexation of texas to the united states not as the conquest of a nation seeking to extend her dominions by arms and violence but as the peaceful acquisition of a territory once her own by adding another member to our confederation with the consent of that member thereby diminishing the chances of war and opening to them new and everincreasing markets for their products" 	 1
"to texas the reunion is important because the strong protecting arm of our government would be extended over her and the vast resources of her fertile soil and genial climate would be speedily developed while the safety of new orleans and of our whole southwestern frontier against hostile aggression as well as the interests of the whole union would be promoted by it" 	 0
"in the earlier stages of our national existence the opinion prevailed with some that our system of confederated states could not operate successfully over an extended territory and serious objections have at different times been made to the enlargement of our boundaries these objections were earnestly urged when we acquired louisiana experience has shown that they were not well founded the title of numerous indian tribes to vast tracts of country has been extinguished new states have been admitted into the union new territories have been created and our jurisdiction and laws extended over them as our population has expanded the union has been cemented and strengthened as our boundaries have been enlarged and our agricultural population has been spread over a large surface our federative system has acquired additional strength and security it may well be doubted whether it would not be in greater danger of overthrow if our present population were confined to the comparatively narrow limits of the original thirteen states than it is now that they are sparsely settled over a more expanded territory it is confidently believed that our system may be safely extended to the utmost bounds of our territorial limits and that as it shall be extended the bonds of our union so far from being weakened will become stronger" 	 1

"whether the elements of inherent force in the republic have kept pace with its unparalleled progression in territory population and wealth has been the subject of earnest thought and discussion on both sides of the ocean less than sixtyfour years ago the father of his country made the then recent accession of the important state of north carolina to the constitution of the united states one of the subjects of his special congratulation at that moment however when the agitation consequent upon the revolutionary struggle had hardly subsided when we were just emerging from the weakness and embarrassments of the confederation there was an evident consciousness of vigor equal to the great mission so wisely and bravely fulfilled by our fathers it was not a presumptuous assurance but a calm faith springing from a clear view of the sources of power in a government constituted like ours it is no paradox to say that although comparatively weak the newborn nation was intrinsically strong inconsiderable in population and apparent resources it was upheld by a broad and intelligent comprehension of rights and an allpervading purpose to maintain them stronger than armaments it came from the furnace of the revolution tempered to the necessities of the times the thoughts of the men of that day were as practical as their sentiments were patriotic they wasted no portion of their energies upon idle and delusive speculations but with a firm and fearless step advanced beyond the governmental landmarks which had hitherto circumscribed the limits of human freedom and planted their standard where it has stood against dangers which have threatened from abroad and internal agitation which has at times fearfully menaced at home they proved themselves equal to the solution of the great problem to understand which their minds had been illuminated by the dawning lights of the revolution the object sought was not a thing dreamed of it was a thing realized they had exhibited only the power to achieve but what all history affirms to be so much more unusual the capacity to maintain the oppressed throughout the world from that day to the present have turned their eyes hitherward not to find those lights extinguished or to fear lest they should wane but to be constantly cheered by their steady and increasing radiance" 	 1

"one of the most impressive evidences of that wisdom is to be found in the fact that the actual working of our system has dispelled a degree of solicitude which at the outset disturbed bold hearts and farreaching intellects the apprehension of dangers from extended territory multiplied states accumulated wealth and augmented population has proved to be unfounded the stars upon your banner have become nearly threefold their original number your densely populated possessions skirt the shores of the two great oceans and yet this vast increase of people and territory has not only shown itself compatible with the harmonious action of the states and federal government in their respective constitutional spheres but has afforded an additional guaranty of the strength and integrity of both" 	 1
"with an experience thus suggestive and cheering the policy of my administration will not be controlled by any timid forebodings of evil from expansion indeed it is not to be disguised that our attitude as a nation and our position on the globe render the acquisition of certain possessions not within our jurisdiction eminently important for our protection if not in the future essential for the preservation of the rights of commerce and the peace of the world should they be obtained it will be through no grasping spirit but with a view to obvious national interest and security and in a manner entirely consistent with the strictest observance of national faith we have nothing in our history or position to invite aggression we have everything to beckon us to the cultivation of relations of peace and amity with all nations purposes therefore at once just and pacific will be significantly marked in the conduct of our foreign affairs i intend that my administration shall leave no blot upon our fair record and trust i may safely give the assurance that no act within the legitimate scope of my constitutional control will be tolerated on the part of any portion of our citizens which can not challenge a ready justification before the tribunal of the civilized world an administration would be unworthy of confidence at home or respect abroad should it cease to be influenced by the conviction that no apparent advantage can be purchased at a price so dear as that of national wrong or dishonor it is not your privilege as a nation to speak of a distant past the striking incidents of your history replete with instruction and furnishing abundant grounds for hopeful confidence are comprised in a period comparatively brief but if your past is limited your future is boundless its obligations throng the unexplored pathway of advancement and will be limitless as duration hence a sound and comprehensive policy should embrace not less the distant future than the urgent present" 	 1

"with these views firmly and honestly carried out we have a right to expect and shall under all circumstances require prompt reciprocity the rights which belong to us as a nation are not alone to be regarded but those which pertain to every citizen in his individual capacity at home and abroad must be sacredly maintained so long as he can discern every star in its place upon that ensign without wealth to purchase for him preferment or title to secure for him place it will be his privilege and must be his acknowledged right to stand unabashed even in the presence of princes with a proud consciousness that he is himself one of a nation of sovereigns and that he can not in legitimate pursuit wander so far from home that the agent whom he shall leave behind in the place which i now occupy will not see that no rude hand of power or tyrannical passion is laid upon him with impunity he must realize that upon every sea and on every soil where our enterprise may rightfully seek the protection of our flag american citizenship is an inviolable panoply for the security of american rights and in this connection it can hardly be necessary to reaffirm a principle which should now be regarded as fundamental the rights security and repose of this confederacy reject the idea of interference or colonization on this side of the ocean by any foreign power beyond present jurisdiction as utterly inadmissible" 	 1
"the opportunities of observation furnished by my brief experience as a soldier confirmed in my own mind the opinion entertained and acted upon by others from the formation of the government that the maintenance of large standing armies in our country would be not only dangerous but unnecessary they also illustrated the importance  i might well say the absolute necessity  of the military science and practical skill furnished in such an eminent degree by the institution which has made your army what it is under the discipline and instruction of officers not more distinguished for their solid attainments gallantry and devotion to the public service than for unobtrusive bearing and high moral tone the army as organized must be the nucleus around which in every time of need the strength of your military power the sure bulwark of your defense  a national militia  may be readily formed into a welldisciplined and efficient organization and the skill and selfdevotion of the navy assure you that you may take the performance of the past as a pledge for the future and may confidently expect that the flag which has waved its untarnished folds over every sea will still float in undiminished honor but these like many other subjects will be appropriately brought at a future time to the attention of the coordinate branches of the government to which i shall always look with profound respect and with trustful confidence that they will accord to me the aid and support which i shall so much need and which their experience and wisdom will readily suggest" 	 0
"in the administration of domestic affairs you expect a devoted integrity in the public service and an observance of rigid economy in all departments so marked as never justly to be questioned if this reasonable expectation be not realized i frankly confess that one of your leading hopes is doomed to disappointment and that my efforts in a very important particular must result in a humiliating failure offices can be properly regarded only in the light of aids for the accomplishment of these objects and as occupancy can confer no prerogative nor importunate desire for preferment any claim the public interest imperatively demands that they be considered with sole reference to the duties to be performed good citizens may well claim the protection of good laws and the benign influence of good government but a claim for office is what the people of a republic should never recognize no reasonable man of any party will expect the administration to be so regardless of its responsibility and of the obvious elements of success as to retain persons known to be under the influence of political hostility and partisan prejudice in positions which will require not only severe labor but cordial cooperation having no implied engagements to ratify no rewards to bestow no resentments to remember and no personal wishes to consult in selections for official station i shall fulfill this difficult and delicate trust admitting no motive as worthy either of my character or position which does not contemplate an efficient discharge of duty and the best interests of my country i acknowledge my obligations to the masses of my countrymen and to them alone higher objects than personal aggrandizement gave direction and energy to their exertions in the late canvass and they shall not be disappointed they require at my hands diligence integrity and capacity wherever there are duties to be performed without these qualities in their public servants more stringent laws for the prevention or punishment of fraud negligence and peculation will be vain with them they will be unnecessary" 	 1
"but these are not the only points to which you look for vigilant watchfulness the dangers of a concentration of all power in the general government of a confederacy so vast as ours are too obvious to be disregarded you have a right therefore to expect your agents in every department to regard strictly the limits imposed upon them by the constitution of the united states the great scheme of our constitutional liberty rests upon a proper distribution of power between the state and federal authorities and experience has shown that the harmony and happiness of our people must depend upon a just discrimination between the separate rights and responsibilities of the states and your common rights and obligations under the general government and here in my opinion are the considerations which should form the true basis of future concord in regard to the questions which have most seriously disturbed public tranquillity if the federal government will confine itself to the exercise of powers clearly granted by the constitution it can hardly happen that its action upon any question should endanger the institutions of the states or interfere with their right to manage matters strictly domestic according to the will of their own people" 	 0
"in expressing briefly my views upon an important subject rich has recently agitated the nation to almost a fearful degree i am moved by no other impulse than a most earnest desire for the perpetuation of that union which has made us what we are showering upon us blessings and conferring a power and influence which our fathers could hardly have anticipated even with their most sanguine hopes directed to a faroff future the sentiments i now announce were not unknown before the expression of the voice which called me here my own position upon this subject was clear and unequivocal upon the record of my words and my acts and it is only recurred to at this time because silence might perhaps be misconstrued with the union my best and dearest earthly hopes are entwined without it what are we individually or collectively what becomes of the noblest field ever opened for the advancement of our race in religion in government in the arts and in all that dignifies and adorns mankind from that radiant constellation which both illumines our own way and points out to struggling nations their course let but a single star be lost and if these be not utter darkness the luster of the whole is dimmed do my countrymen need any assurance that such a catastrophe is not to overtake them while i possess the power to stay it it is with me an earnest and vital belief that as the union has been the source under providence of our prosperity to this time so it is the surest pledge of a continuance of the blessings we have enjoyed and which we are sacredly bound to transmit undiminished to our children the field of calm and free discussion in our country is open and will always be so but never has been and never can be traversed for good in a spirit of sectionalism and uncharitableness the founders of the republic dealt with things as they were presented to them in a spirit of selfsacrificing patriotism and as time has proved with a comprehensive wisdom which it will always be safe for us to consult every measure tending to strengthen the fraternal feelings of all the members of our union has had my heartfelt approbation to every theory of society or government whether the offspring of feverish ambition or of morbid enthusiasm calculated to dissolve the bonds of law and affection which unite us i shall interpose a ready and stern resistance i believe that involuntary servitude as it exists in different states of this confederacy is recognized by the constitution i believe that it stands like any other admitted right and that the states where it exists are entitled to efficient remedies to enforce the constitutional provisions i hold that the laws of 1850 commonly called the compromise measures are strictly constitutional and to be unhesitatingly carried into effect i believe that the constituted authorities of this republic are bound to regard the rights of the south in this respect as they would view any other legal and constitutional right and that the laws to enforce them should be respected and obeyed not with a reluctance encouraged by abstract opinions as to their propriety in a different state of society but cheerfully and according to the decisions of the tribunal to which their exposition belongs such have been and are my convictions and upon them i shall act i fervently hope that the question is at rest and that no sectional or ambitious or fanatical excitement may again threaten the durability of our institutions or obscure the light of our prosperity" 	 1
"but let not the foundation of our hope rest upon mans wisdom it will not be sufficient that sectional prejudices find no place in the public deliberations it will not be sufficient that the rash counsels of human passion are rejected it must be felt that there is no national security but in the nations humble acknowledged dependence upon god and his overruling providence" 	 0
"we have been carried in safety through a perilous crisis wise counsels like those which gave us the constitution prevailed to uphold it let the period be remembered as an admonition and not as an encouragement in any section of the union to make experiments where experiments are fraught with such fearful hazard let it be impressed upon all hearts that beautiful as our fabric is no earthly power or wisdom could ever reunite its broken fragments standing as i do almost within view of the green slopes of monticello and as it were within reach of the tomb of washington with all the cherished memories of the past gathering around me like so many eloquent voices of exhortation from heaven i can express no better hope for my country than that the kind providence which smiled upon our fathers may enable their children to preserve the blessings they have inherited" 	 0
"fellow citizens i appear before you this day to take the solemn oath that i will faithfully execute the office of president of the united states and will to the best of my ability preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states" 	 1
"in entering upon this great office i must humbly invoke the god of our fathers for wisdom and firmness to execute its high and responsible duties in such a manner as to restore harmony and ancient friendship among the people of the several states and to preserve our free institutions throughout many generations convinced that i owe my election to the inherent love for the constitution and the union which still animates the hearts of the american people let me earnestly ask their powerful support in sustaining all just measures calculated to perpetuate these the richest political blessings which heaven has ever bestowed upon any nation having determined not to become a candidate for reelection i shall have no motive to influence my conduct in administering the government except the desire ably and faithfull to serve my country and to live in grateful memory of my countrymen" 	 0
"we have recently passed through a presidential contest in which the passions of our fellowcitizens were excited to the highest degree by questions of deep and vital importance but when the people proclaimed their will the tempest at once subsided and all was calm" 	 1
"the voice of the majority speaking in the manner prescribed by the constitution was heard and instant submission followed our own country could alone have exhibited so grand and striking a spectacle of the capacity of man for selfgovernment" 	 0
"what a happy conception then was it for congress to apply this simple rule that the will of the majority shall govern to the settlement of the question of domestic slavery in the territories congress is neither to legislate slavery into any territory or state nor to exclude it therefrom but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way subject only to the constitution of the united states" 	 1
"as a natural consequence congress has also prescribed that when the territory of kansas shall be admitted as a state it shall be received into the union with or without slavery as their constitution may prescribe at the time of their admission" 	 1
"a difference of opinion has arisen in regard to the point of time when the people of a territory shall decide this question for themselves" 	 0
"this is happily a matter of but little practical importance besides it is a judicial question which legitimately belongs to the supreme court of the united states before whom it is now pending and will it is understood be speedily and finally settled to their decision in common with all good citizens i shall cheerfully submit whatever this may be though it has ever been my individual opinion that under the nebraskakansas act the appropriate period will be when the number of actual residents in the territory shall justify the formation of a constitution with a view to its admission as a state into the union but be this as it may it is the imperative and indispensable duty of the government of the united states to secure to every resident inhabitant the free and independent expression of his opinion by his vote this sacred right of each individual must be preserved that being accomplished nothing can be fairer than to leave the people of a territory free from all foreign interference to decide their own destiny for themselves subject only to the constitution of the united states" 	 0
"the whole territorial question being thus settled upon the principle of popular sovereignty  a principle as ancient as free government itselfeverything of a practical nature has been decided no other question remains for adjustment because all agree that under the constitution slavery in the states is beyond the reach of any human power except that of the respective states themselves wherein it exists may we not then hope that the long agitation on this subject is approaching its end and that the geographical parties to which it has given birth so much dreaded by the father of his country will speedily become extinct most happy will it be for the country when the public mind shall be diverted from this question to others of more pressing and practical importance throughout the whole progress of this agitation which has scarcely known any intermission for more than twenty years whilst it has been productive of no positive good to any human being it has been the prolific source of great evils to the master to the slave and to the whole country it has alienated and estranged the people of the sister states from each other and has even seriously endangered the very existence of the union nor has the danger yet entirely ceased under our system there is a remedy for all mere political evils in the sound sense and sober judgment of the people time is a great corrective political subjects which but a few years ago excited and exasperated the public mind have passed away and are now nearly forgotten but this question of domestic slavery is of far graver importance than any mere political question because should the agitation continue it may eventually endanger the personal safety of a large portion of our countrymen where the institution exists in that event no form of government however admirable in itself and however productive of material benefits can compensate for the loss of peace and domestic security around the family altar let every unionloving man therefore exert his best influence to suppress this agitation which since the recent legislation of congress is without any legitimate object" 	 1
"it is an evil omen of the times that men have undertaken to calculate the mere material value of the union reasoned estimates have been presented of the pecuniary profits and local advantages which would result to different states and sections from its dissolution and of the comparative injuries which such an event would inflict on other states and sections even descending to this low and narrow view of the mighty question all such calculations are at fault the bare reference to a single consideration will be conclusive on this point we at present enjoy a free trade throughout our extensive and expanding country such as the world has never witnessed this trade is conducted on railroads and canals on noble rivers and arms of the sea which bind together the north and the south the east and the west of our confederacy annihilate this trade arrest its free progress by the geographical lines of jealous and hostile states and you destroy the prosperity and onward march of the whole and every part and involve all in one common ruin but such considerations important as they are in themselves sink into insignificance when we reflect on the terrific evils which would result from disunion to every portion of the confederacy  to the north not more than to the south to the east not more than to the west these i shall not attempt to portray because i feel an humble confidence that the kind providence which inspired our fathers with wisdom to frame the most perfect form of government and union ever devised by man will not suffer it to perish until it shall have been peacefully instrumental by its example in the extension of civil and religious liberty throughout the world" 	 1
"next in importance to the maintenance of the constitution and the union is the duty of preserving the government free from the taint or even the suspicion of corruption public virtue is the vital spirit of republics and history proves that when this has decayed and the love of money has usurped its place although the forms of free government may remain for a season the substance has departed forever" 	 0
"our present financial condition is without a parallel in history no nation has ever before been embarrassed from too large a surplus in its treasury this almost necessarily gives birth to extravagant legislation it produces wild schemes of expenditure and begets a race of speculators and jobbers whose ingenuity is exerted in contriving and promoting expedients to obtain public money the purity of official agents whether rightfully or wrongfully is suspected and the character of the government suffers in the estimation of the people this is in itself a very great evil" 	 0
"the natural mode of relief from this embarrassment is to appropriate the surplus in the treasury to great national objects for which a clear warrant can be found in the constitution among these i might mention the extinguishment of the public debt a reasonable increase of the navy which is at present inadequate to the protection of our vast tonnage afloat now greater than that of any other nation as well as to the defense of our extended seacoast" 	 0
"it is beyond all question the true principle that no more revenue ought to be collected from the people than the amount necessary to defray the expenses of a wise economical and efficient administration of the government to reach this point it was necessary to resort to a modification of the tariff and this has i trust been accomplished in such a manner as to do as little injury as may have been practicable to our domestic manufactures especially those necessary for the defense of the country any discrimination against a particular branch for the purpose of benefiting favored corporations individuals or interests would have been unjust to the rest of the community and inconsistent with that spirit of fairness and equality which ought to govern in the adjustment of a revenue tariff" 	 1
"but the squandering of the public money sinks into comparative insignificance as a temptation to corruption when compared with the squandering of the public lands" 	 0
"no nation in the tide of time has ever been blessed with so rich and noble an inheritance as we enjoy in the public lands in administering this important trust whilst it may be wise to grant portions of them for the improvement of the remainder yet we should never forget that it is our cardinal policy to reserve these lands as much as may be for actual settlers and this at moderate prices we shall thus not only best promote the prosperity of the new states and territories by furnishing them a hardy and independent race of honest and industrious citizens but shall secure homes for our children and our childrens children as well as for those exiles from foreign shores who may seek in this country to improve their condition and to enjoy the blessings of civil and religious liberty such emigrants have done much to promote the growth and prosperity of the country they have proved faithful both in peace and in war after becoming citizens they are entitled under the constitution and laws to be placed on a perfect equality with nativeborn citizens and in this character they should ever be kindly recognized the federal constitution is a grant from the states to congress of certain specific powers and the question whether this grant should be liberally or strictly construed has more or less divided political parties from the beginning without entering into the argument i desire to state at the commencement of my administration that long experience and observation have convinced me that a strict construction of the powers of the government i the only true as well as the only safe theory of the constitution whenever in our past history doubtful powers have been exercised by congress these have never failed to produce injurious and unhappy consequences many such instances might be adduced if this were the proper occasion neither is it necessary for the public service to strain the language of the constitution because all the great and useful powers required for a successful administration of the government both in peace and in war have been granted either in express terms or by the plainest implication" 	 1
"whilst deeply convinced of these truths i yet consider it clear that under the warmaking power congress may appropriate money toward the construction of a military road when this is absolutely necessary for the defense of any state or territory of the union against foreign invasion under the constitution congress has power to declare war to raise and support armies to provide and maintain a navy and to call forth the militia to repel invasions thus endowed in an ample manner with the warmaking power the corresponding duty is required that the united states shall protect each of them the states against invasion now how is it possible to afford this protection to california and our pacific possessions except by means of a military road through the territories of the united states over which men and munitions of war may be speedily transported from the atlantic states to meet and to repel the invader in the event of a war with a naval power much stronger than our own we should then have no other available access to the pacific coast because such a power would instantly close the route across the isthmus of central america it is impossible to conceive that whilst the constitution has expressly required congress to defend all the states it should yet deny to them by any fair construction the only possible means by which one of these states can be defended besides the government ever since its origin has been in the constant practice of constructing military roads it might also be wise to consider whether the love for the union which now animates our fellowcitizens on the pacific coast may not be impaired by our neglect or refusal to provide for them in their remote and isolated condition the only means by which the power of the states on this side of the rocky mountains can reach them in sufficient time to protect them against invasion i forbear for the present from expressing an opinion as to the wisest and most economical mode in which the government can lend its aid in accomplishing this great and necessary work i believe that many of the difficulties in the way which now appear formidable will in a great degree vanish as soon as the nearest and best route shall have been satisfactorily ascertained" 	 0
"it may be proper that on this occasion i should make some brief remarks in regard to our rights and duties as a member of the great family of nations in our intercourse with them there are some plain principles approved by our own experience from which we should never depart we ought to cultivate peace commerce and friendship with all nations and this not merely as the best means of promoting our own material interests but in a spirit of christian benevolence toward our fellowmen wherever their lot may be cast our diplomacy should be direct and frank neither seeking to obtain more nor accepting less than is our due we ought to cherish a sacred regard for the independence of all nations and never attempt to interfere in the domestic concerns of any unless this shall be imperatively required by the great law of selfpreservation to avoid entangling alliances has been a maxim of our policy ever since the days of washington and its wisdoms no one will attempt to dispute in short we ought to do justice in a kindly spirit to all nations and require justice from them in return" 	 1
"it is our glory that whilst other nations have extended their dominions by the sword we have never acquired any territory except by fair purchase or as in the case of texas by the voluntary determination of a brave kindred and independent people to blend their destinies with our own even our acquisitions from mexico form no exception unwilling to take advantage of the fortune of war against a sister republic we purchased these possessions under the treaty of peace for a sum which was considered at the time a fair equivalent our past history forbids that we shall in the future acquire territory unless this be sanctioned by the laws of justice and honor acting on this principle no nation will have a right to interfere or to complain if in the progress of events we shall still further extend our possessions hitherto in all our acquisitions the people under the protection of the american flag have enjoyed civil and religious liberty as well as equal and just laws and have been contented prosperous and happy their trade with the rest of the world has rapidly increased and thus every commercial nation has shared largely in their successful progress" 	 0
"i shall now proceed to take the oath prescribed by the constitution whilst humbly invoking the blessing of divine providence on this great people" 	 0
"fellowcitizens of the united states in compliance with a custom as old as the government itself i appear before you to address you briefly and to take in your presence the oath prescribed by the constitution of the united states to be taken by the president before he enters on the execution of this office" 	 0
"i do not consider it necessary at present for me to discuss those matters of administration about which there is no special anxiety or excitement" 	 1
"apprehension seems to exist among the people of the southern states that by the accession of a republican administration their property and their peace and personal security are to be endangered there has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension indeed the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to their inspection it is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you i do but quote from one of those speeches when i declare that" 	 1
"i have no purpose directly or indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists i believe i have no lawful right to do so and i have no inclination to do so" 	 1
"those who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledge that i had made this and many similar declarations and had never recanted them and more than this they placed in the platform for my acceptance and as a law to themselves and to me the clear and emphatic resolution which i now read" 	 0
"resolved that the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the states and especially the right of each state to order and control its own domestic institutions according to its own judgment exclusively is essential to that balance of power on which the perfection and endurance of our political fabric depend and we denounce the lawless invasion by armed force of the soil of any state or territory no matter what pretext as among the gravest of crimes" 	 0
"i now reiterate these sentiments and in doing so i only press upon the public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case is susceptible that the property peace and security of no section are to be in any wise endangered by the now incoming administration i add too that all the protection which consistently with the constitution and the laws can be given will be cheerfully given to all the states when lawfully demanded for whatever cause  as cheerfully to one section as to another" 	 1
"there is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives from service or labor the clause i now read is as plainly written in the constitution as any other of its provisions" 	 0
"no person held to service or labor in one state under the laws thereof escaping into another shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharged from such service or labor but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due" 	 0
"it is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those who made it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves and the intention of the lawgiver is the law all members of congress swear their support to the whole constitution  to this provision as much as to any other to the proposition then that slaves whose cases come within the terms of this clause shall be delivered up their oaths are unanimous now if they would make the effort in good temper could they not with nearly equal unanimity frame and pass a law by means of which to keep good that unanimous oath" 	 1
"there is some difference of opinion whether this clause should be enforced by national or by state authority but surely that difference is not a very material one if the slave is to be surrendered it can be of but little consequence to him or to others by which authority it is done and should anyone in any case be content that his oath shall go unkept on a merely unsubstantial controversy as to how it shall be kept" 	 1
"again in any law upon this subject ought not all the safeguards of liberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced so that a free man be not in any case surrendered as a slave and might it not be well at the same time to provide by law for the enforcement of that clause in the constitution which guarantees that the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states" 	 1
"i take the official oath today with no mental reservations and with no purpose to construe the constitution or laws by any hypercritical rules and while i do not choose now to specify particular acts of congress as proper to be enforced i do suggest that it will be much safer for all both in official and private stations to conform to and abide by all those acts which stand unrepealed than to violate any of them trusting to find impunity in having them held to be unconstitutional" 	 0
"it is seventytwo years since the first inauguration of a president under our national constitution during that period fifteen different and greatly distinguished citizens have in succession administered the executive branch of the government they have conducted it through many perils and generally with great success yet with all this scope of precedent i now enter upon the same task for the brief constitutional term of four years under great and peculiar difficulty a disruption of the federal union heretofore only menaced is now formidably attempted" 	 0
"i hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the constitution the union of these states is perpetual perpetuity is implied if not expressed in the fundamental law of all national governments it is safe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision in its organic law for its own termination continue to execute all the express provisions of our national constitution and the union will endure forever it being impossible to destroy it except by some action not provided for in the instrument itself" 	 0
"again if the united states be not a government proper but an association of states in the nature of contract merely can it as a contract be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it one party to a contract may violate it  break it so to speak  but does it not require all to lawfully rescind it" 	 0
"descending from these general principles we find the proposition that in legal contemplation the union is perpetual confirmed by the history of the union itself the union is much older than the constitution it was formed in fact by the articles of association in 1774 it was matured and continued by the declaration of independence in 1776 it was further matured and the faith of all the then thirteen states expressly plighted and engaged that it should be perpetual by the articles of confederation in 1778 and finally in 1787 one of the declared objects for ordaining and establishing the constitution was to form a more perfect union" 	 0
"but if destruction of the union by one or by a part only of the states be lawfully possible the union is less perfect than before the constitution having lost the vital element of perpetuity" 	 1
"it follows from these views that no state upon its own mere motion can lawfully get out of the union that resolves and ordinances to that effect are legally void and that acts of violence within any state or states against the authority of the united states are insurrectionary or revolutionary according to circumstances" 	 0
"i therefore consider that in view of the constitution and the laws the union is unbroken and to the extent of my ability i shall take care as the constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me that the laws of the union be faithfully executed in all the states doing this i deem to be only a simple duty on my part and i shall perform it so far as practicable unless my rightful masters the american people shall withhold the requisite means or in some authoritative manner direct the contrary i trust this will not be regarded as a menace but only as the declared purpose of the union that it will constitutionally defend and maintain itself" 	 0
"in doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence and there shall be none unless it be forced upon the national authority the power confided to me will be used to hold occupy and possess the property and places belonging to the government and to collect the duties and imposts but beyond what may be necessary for these objects there will be no invasion no using of force against or among the people anywhere where hostility to the united states in any interior locality shall be so great and universal as to prevent competent resident citizens from holding the federal offices there will be no attempt to force obnoxious strangers among the people for that object while the strict legal right may exist in the government to enforce the exercise of these offices the attempt to do so would be so irritating and so nearly impracticable withal that i deem it better to forego for the time the uses of such offices" 	 1
"the mails unless repelled will continue to be furnished in all parts of the union so far as possible the people everywhere shall have that sense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought and reflection the course here indicated will be followed unless current events and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper and in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised according to circumstances actually existing and with a view and a hope of a peaceful solution of the national troubles and the restoration of fraternal sympathies and affections" 	 0
"that there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy the union at all events and are glad of any pretext to do it i will neither affirm nor deny but if there be such i need address no word to them to those however who really love the union may i not speak" 	 1
"before entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our national fabric with all its benefits its memories and its hopes would it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it will you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility that any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence will you while the certain ills you fly to are greater than all the real ones you fly from will you risk the commission of so fearful a mistake" 	 1
"all profess to be content in the union if all constitutional rights can be maintained is it true then that any right plainly written in the constitution has been denied i think not happily the human mind is so constituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this think if you can of a single instance in which a plainly written provision of the constitution has ever been denied if by the mere force of numbers a majority should deprive a minority of any clearly written constitutional right it might in a moral point of view justify revolution certainly would if such right were a vital one but such is not our case all the vital rights of minorities and of individuals are so plainly assured to them by affirmations and negations guaranties and prohibitions in the constitution that controversies never arise concerning them but no organic law can ever be framed with a provision specifically applicable to every question which may occur in practical administration no foresight can anticipate nor any document of reasonable length contain express provisions for all possible questions shall fugitives from labor be surrendered by national or by state authority the constitution does not expressly say may congress prohibit slavery in the territories the constitution does not expressly say must congress protect slavery in the territories the constitution does not expressly say" 	 1
"from questions of this class spring all our constitutional controversies and we divide upon them into majorities and minorities if the minority will not acquiesce the majority must or the government must cease there is no other alternative for continuing the government is acquiescence on one side or the other if a minority in such case will secede rather than acquiesce they make a precedent which in turn will divide and ruin them for a minority of their own will secede from them whenever a majority refuses to be controlled by such minority for instance why may not any portion of a new confederacy a year or two hence arbitrarily secede again precisely as portions of the present union now claim to secede from it all who cherish disunion sentiments are now being educated to the exact temper of doing this" 	 1
"is there such perfect identity of interests among the states to compose a new union as to produce harmony only and prevent renewed secession" 	 0
"plainly the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy a majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments is the only true sovereign of a free people whoever rejects it does of necessity fly to anarchy or to despotism unanimity is impossible the rule of a minority as a permanent arrangement is wholly inadmissible so that rejecting the majority principle anarchy or despotism in some form is all that is left" 	 1
"i do not forget the position assumed by some that constitutional questions are to be decided by the supreme court nor do i deny that such decisions must be binding in any case upon the parties to a suit as to the object of that suit while they are also entitled to very high respect and consideration in all parallel cases by all other departments of the government and while it is obviously possible that such decision may be erroneous in any given case still the evil effect following it being limited to that particular case with the chance that it may be overruled and never become a precedent for other cases can better be borne than could the evils of a different practice at the same time the candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the government upon vital questions affecting the whole people is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the supreme court the instant they are made in ordinary litigation between parties in personal actions the people will have ceased to be their own rulers having to that extent practically resigned their government into the hands of that eminent tribunal nor is there in this view any assault upon the court or the judges it is a duty from which they may not shrink to decide cases properly brought before them and it is no fault of theirs if others seek to turn their decisions to political purposes" 	 0
"one section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended this is the only substantial dispute the fugitiveslave clause of the constitution and the law for the suppression of the foreign slave trade are each as well enforced perhaps as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself the great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases and a few break over in each this i think can not be perfectly cured and it would be worse in both cases after the separation of the sections than before the foreign slave trade now imperfectly suppressed would be ultimately revived without restriction in one section while fugitive slaves now only partially surrendered would not be surrendered at all by the other" 	 1

"ultimately it may be necessary to insure the facilities to reach these riches and it may be necessary also that the general government should give its aid to secure this access but that should only be when a dollar of obligation to pay secures precisely the same sort of dollar to use now and not before whilst the question of specie payments is in abeyance the prudent business man is careful about contracting debts payable in the distant future the nation should follow the same rule a prostrate commerce is to be rebuilt and all industries encouraged" 	 0

"the supreme trial of the constitution came at last under the tremendous pressure of civil war we ourselves are witnesses that the union emerged from the blood and fire of that conflict purified and made stronger for all the beneficent purposes of good government" 	 0
"and now at the close of this first century of growth with the inspirations of its history in their hearts our people have lately reviewed the condition of the nation passed judgment upon the conduct and opinions of political parties and have registered their will concerning the future administration of the government to interpret and to execute that will in accordance with the constitution is the paramount duty of the executive" 	 1
"even from this brief review it is manifest that the nation is resolutely facing to the front resolved to employ its best energies in developing the great possibilities of the future sacredly preserving whatever has been gained to liberty and good government during the century our people are determined to leave behind them all those bitter controversies concerning things which have been irrevocably settled and the further discussion of which can only stir up strife and delay the onward march" 	 1
"the supremacy of the nation and its laws should be no longer a subject of debate that discussion which for half a century threatened the existence of the union was closed at last in the high court of war by a decree from which there is no appeal  that the constitution and the laws made in pursuance thereof are and shall continue to be the supreme law of the land binding alike upon the states and the people this decree does not disturb the autonomy of the states nor interfere with any of their necessary rights of local selfgovernment but it does fix and establish the permanent supremacy of the union" 	 1
"the will of the nation speaking with the voice of battle and through the amended constitution has fulfilled the great promise of 1776 by proclaiming liberty throughout the land to all the inhabitants thereof" 	 1
"the elevation of the negro race from slavery to the full rights of citizenship is the most important political change we have known since the adoption of the constitution of 1787 no thoughtful man can fail to appreciate its beneficent effect upon our institutions and people it has freed us from the perpetual danger of war and dissolution it has added immensely to the moral and industrial forces of our people it has liberated the master as well as the slave from a relation which wronged and enfeebled both it has surrendered to their own guardianship the manhood of more than 5000000 people and has opened to each one of them a career of freedom and usefulness it has given new inspiration to the power of selfhelp in both races by making labor more honorable to the one and more necessary to the other the influence of this force will grow greater and bear richer fruit with the coming years" 	 0
"no doubt this great change has caused serious disturbance to our southern communities this is to be deplored though it was perhaps unavoidable but those who resisted the change should remember that under our institutions there was no middle ground for the negro race between slavery and equal citizenship there can be no permanent disfranchised peasantry in the united states freedom can never yield its fullness of blessings so long as the law or its administration places the smallest obstacle in the pathway of any virtuous citizen" 	 0
"the emancipated race has already made remarkable progress with unquestioning devotion to the union with a patience and gentleness not born of fear they have followed the light as god gave them to see the light they are rapidly laying the material foundations of selfsupport widening their circle of intelligence and beginning to enjoy the blessings that gather around the homes of the industrious poor they deserve the generous encouragement of all good men so far as my authority can lawfully extend they shall enjoy the full and equal protection of the constitution and the laws" 	 0
"the free enjoyment of equal suffrage is still in question and a frank statement of the issue may aid its solution it is alleged that in many communities negro citizens are practically denied the freedom of the ballot in so far as the truth of this allegation is admitted it is answered that in many places honest local government is impossible if the mass of uneducated negroes are allowed to vote these are grave allegations so far as the latter is true it is the only palliation that can be offered for opposing the freedom of the ballot bad local government is certainly a great evil which ought to be prevented but to violate the freedom and sanctities of the suffrage is more than an evil it is a crime which if persisted in will destroy the government itself suicide is not a remedy if in other lands it be high treason to compass the death of the king it shall be counted no less a crime here to strangle our sovereign power and stifle its voice" 	 0
"it has been said that unsettled questions have no pity for the repose of nations it should be said with the utmost emphasis that this question of the suffrage will never give repose or safety to the states or to the nation until each within its own jurisdiction makes and keeps the ballot free and pure by the strong sanctions of the law" 	 1
"but the danger which arises from ignorance in the voter can not be denied it covers a field far wider than that of negro suffrage and the present condition of the race it is a danger that lurks and hides in the sources and fountains of power in every state we have no standard by which to measure the disaster that may be brought upon us by ignorance and vice in the citizens when joined to corruption and fraud in the suffrage" 	 1
"the voters of the union who make and unmake constitutions and upon whose will hang the destinies of our governments can transmit their supreme authority to no successors save the coming generation of voters who are the sole heirs of sovereign power if that generation comes to its inheritance blinded by ignorance and corrupted by vice the fall of the republic will be certain and remediless" 	 0
"the census has already sounded the alarm in the appalling figures which mark how dangerously high the tide of illiteracy has risen among our voters and their children" 	 1
"to the south this question is of supreme importance but the responsibility for the existence of slavery did not rest upon the south alone the nation itself is responsible for the extension of the suffrage and is under special obligations to aid in removing the illiteracy which it has added to the voting population for the north and south alike there is but one remedy all the constitutional power of the nation and of the states and all the volunteer forces of the people should be surrendered to meet this danger by the savory influence of universal education" 	 0

"in this beneficent work sections and races should be forgotten and partisanship should be unknown let our people find a new meaning in the divine oracle which declares that a little child shall lead them for our own little children will soon control the destinies of the republic" 	 0
"my countrymen we do not now differ in our judgment concerning the controversies of past generations and fifty years hence our children will not be divided in their opinions concerning our controversies they will surely bless their fathers and their fathers god that the union was preserved that slavery was overthrown and that both races were made equal before the law we may hasten or we may retard but we can not prevent the final reconciliation is it not possible for us now to make a truce with time by anticipating and accepting its inevitable verdict" 	 1
"enterprises of the highest importance to our moral and material wellbeing unite us and offer ample employment of our best powers let all our people leaving behind them the battlefields of dead issues move forward and in their strength of liberty and the restored union win the grander victories of peace" 	 0
"the prosperity which now prevails is without parallel in our history fruitful seasons have done much to secure it but they have not done all the preservation of the public credit and the resumption of specie payments so successfully attained by the administration of my predecessors have enabled our people to secure the blessings which the seasons brought" 	 1
"by the experience of commercial nations in all ages it has been found that gold and silver afford the only safe foundation for a monetary system confusion has recently been created by variations in the relative value of the two metals but i confidently believe that arrangements can be made between the leading commercial nations which will secure the general use of both metals congress should provide that the compulsory coinage of silver now required by law may not disturb our monetary system by driving either metal of circulation if possible such an adjustment should be made that the purchasing power of every coined dollar will be exactly equal to its debtpaying power in all the markets of the world" 	 1
"the chief duty of the national government in connection with the currency of the country is to coin money and declare its value grave doubts have been entertained whether congress is authorized by the constitution to make any form of paper money legal tender the present issue of united states notes has been sustained by the necessities of war but such paper should depend for its value and currency upon its convenience in use and its prompt redemption in coin at the will of the holder and not upon its compulsory circulation these notes are not money but promises to pay money if the holders demand it the promise should be kept" 	 0
"the refunding of the national debt at a lower rate of interest should be accomplished without compelling the withdrawal of the nationalbank notes and thus disturbing the business of the country" 	 0
"i venture to refer to the position i have occupied on financial questions during a long service in congress and to say that time and experience have strengthened the opinions i have so often expressed on these subjects" 	 0
"the finances of the government shall suffer no detriment which it may be possible for my administration to prevent" 	 0
"the interests of agriculture deserve more attention from the government than they have yet received the farms of the united states afford homes and employment for more than onehalf our people and furnish much the largest part of all our exports as the government lights our coasts for the protection of mariners and the benefit of commerce so it should give to the tillers of the soil the best lights of practical science and experience" 	 1
"our manufacturers are rapidly making us industrially independent and are opening to capital and labor new and profitable fields of employment their steady and healthy growth should still be matured our facilities for transportation should be promoted by the continued improvement of our harbors and great interior waterways and by the increase of our tonnage on the ocean" 	 0
"the development of the worlds commerce has led to an urgent demand for shortening the great sea voyage around cape horn by constructing ship canals or railways across the isthmus which unites the continents various plans to this end have been suggested and will need consideration but none of them has been sufficiently matured to warrant the united states in extending pecuniary aid the subject however is one which will immediately engage the attention of the government with a view to a thorough protection to american interests we will urge no narrow policy nor seek peculiar or exclusive privileges in any commercial route but in the language of my predecessor i believe it to be the right and duty of the united states to assert and maintain such supervision and authority over any interoceanic canal across the isthmus that connects north and south america as will protect our national interest" 	 0
"the constitution guarantees absolute religious freedom congress is prohibited from making any law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof the territories of the united states are subject to the direct legislative authority of congress and hence the general government is responsible for any violation of the constitution in any of them it is therefore a reproach to the government that in the most populous of the territories the constitutional guaranty is not enjoyed by the people and the authority of congress is set at naught the mormon church not only offends the moral sense of manhood by sanctioning polygamy but prevents the administration of justice through ordinary instrumentalities of law" 	 1
"in my judgment it is the duty of congress while respecting to the uttermost the conscientious convictions and religious scruples of every citizen to prohibit within its jurisdiction all criminal practices especially of that class which destroy the family relations and endanger social order nor can any ecclesiastical organization be safely permitted to usurp in the smallest degree the functions and powers of the national government" 	 1
"the civil service can never be placed on a satisfactory basis until it is regulated by law for the good of the service itself for the protection of those who are intrusted with the appointing power against the waste of time and obstruction to the public business caused by the inordinate pressure for place and for the protection of incumbents against intrigue and wrong i shall at the proper time ask congress to fix the tenure of the minor offices of the several executive departments and prescribe the grounds upon which removals shall be made during the terms for which incumbents have been appointed" 	 0
"finally acting always within the authority and limitations of the constitution invading neither the rights of the states nor the reserved rights of the people it will be the purpose of my administration to maintain the authority of the nation in all places within its jurisdiction to enforce obedience to all the laws of the union in the interests of the people to demand rigid economy in all the expenditures of the government and to require the honest and faithful service of all executive officers remembering that the offices were created not for the benefit of incumbents or their supporters but for the service of the government" 	 0
"and now fellowcitizens i am about to assume the great trust which you have committed to my hands i appeal to you for that earnest and thoughtful support which makes this government in fact as it is in law a government of the people" 	 0

"this impressive ceremony adds little to the solemn sense of responsibility with which i contemplate the duty i owe to all the people of the land nothing can relieve me from anxiety lest by any act of mine their interests may suffer and nothing is needed to strengthen my resolution to engage every faculty and effort in the promotion of their welfare" 	 0
"amid the din of party strife the peoples choice was made but its attendant circumstances have demonstrated anew the strength and safety of a government by the people in each succeeding year it more clearly appears that our democratic principle needs no apology and that in its fearless and faithful application is to be found the surest guaranty of good government" 	 0
"but the best results in the operation of a government wherein every citizen has a share largely depend upon a proper limitation of purely partisan zeal and effort and a correct appreciation of the time when the heat of the partisan should be merged in the patriotism of the citizen" 	 1
"today the executive branch of the government is transferred to new keeping but this is still the government of all the people and it should be none the less an object of their affectionate solicitude at this hour the animosities of political strife the bitterness of partisan defeat and the exultation of partisan triumph should be supplanted by an ungrudging acquiescence in the popular will and a sober conscientious concern for the general weal moreover if from this hour we cheerfully and honestly abandon all sectional prejudice and distrust and determine with manly confidence in one another to work out harmoniously the achievements of our national destiny we shall deserve to realize all the benefits which our happy form of government can bestow" 	 0
"on this auspicious occasion we may well renew the pledge of our devotion to the constitution which launched by the founders of the republic and consecrated by their prayers and patriotic devotion has for almost a century borne the hopes and the aspirations of a great people through prosperity and peace and through the shock of foreign conflicts and the perils of domestic strife and vicissitudes" 	 1
"by the father of his country our constitution was commended for adoption as the result of a spirit of amity and mutual concession in that same spirit it should be administered in order to promote the lasting welfare of the country and to secure the full measure of its priceless benefits to us and to those who will succeed to the blessings of our national life the large variety of diverse and competing interests subject to federal control persistently seeking the recognition of their claims need give us no fear that the greatest good to the greatest number will fail to be accomplished if in the halls of national legislation that spirit of amity and mutual concession shall prevail in which the constitution had its birth if this involves the surrender or postponement of private interests and the abandonment of local advantages compensation will be found in the assurance that the common interest is subserved and the general welfare advanced" 	 0
"in the discharge of my official duty i shall endeavor to be guided by a just and unstrained construction of the constitution a careful observance of the distinction between the powers granted to the federal government and those reserved to the states or to the people and by a cautious appreciation of those functions which by the constitution and laws have been especially assigned to the executive branch of the government" 	 1
"but he who takes the oath today to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states only assumes the solemn obligation which every patriotic citizen  on the farm in the workshop in the busy marts of trade and everywhere  should share with him the constitution which prescribes his oath my countrymen is yours the government you have chosen him to administer for a time is yours the suffrage which executes the will of freemen is yours the laws and the entire scheme of our civil rule from the town meeting to the state capitals and the national capital is yours your every voter as surely as your chief magistrate under the same high sanction though in a different sphere exercises a public trust nor is this all every citizen owes to the country a vigilant watch and close scrutiny of its public servants and a fair and reasonable estimate of their fidelity and usefulness thus is the peoples will impressed upon the whole framework of our civil politymunicipal state and federal and this is the price of our liberty and the inspiration of our faith in the republic" 	 1
"it is the duty of those serving the people in public place to closely limit public expenditures to the actual needs of the government economically administered because this bounds the right of the government to exact tribute from the earnings of labor or the property of the citizen and because public extravagance begets extravagance among the people we should never be ashamed of the simplicity and prudential economies which are best suited to the operation of a republican form of government and most compatible with the mission of the american people those who are selected for a limited time to manage public affairs are still of the people and may do much by their example to encourage consistently with the dignity of their official functions that plain way of life which among their fellow citizens aids integrity and promotes thrift and prosperity" 	 0
"the genius of our institutions the needs of our people in their home life and the attention which is demanded for the settlement and development of the resources of our vast territory dictate the scrupulous avoidance of any departure from that foreign policy commended by the history the traditions and the prosperity of our republic it is the policy of independence favored by our position and defended by our known love of justice and by our power it is the policy of peace suitable to our interests it is the policy of neutrality rejecting any share in foreign broils and ambitions upon other continents and repelling their intrusion here it is the policy of monroe and of washington and jefferson  peace commerce and honest friendship with all nations entangling alliance with none" 	 1
"a due regard for the interests and prosperity of all the people demands that our finances shall be established upon such a sound and sensible basis as shall secure the safety and confidence of business interests and make the wage of labor sure and steady and that our system of revenue shall be so adjusted as to relieve the people of unnecessary taxation having a due regard to the interests of capital invested and workingmen employed in american industries and preventing the accumulation of a surplus in the treasury to tempt extravagance and waste" 	 0
"care for the property of the nation and for the needs of future settlers requires that the public domain should be protected from purloining schemes and unlawful occupation" 	 0
"the conscience of the people demands that the indians within our boundaries shall be fairly and honestly treated as wards of the government and their education and civilization promoted with a view to their ultimate citizenship and that polygamy in the territories destructive of the family relation and offensive to the moral sense of the civilized world shall be repressed" 	 1
"the laws should be rigidly enforced which prohibit the immigration of a servile class to compete with american labor with no intention of acquiring citizenship and bringing with them and retaining habits and customs repugnant to our civilization" 	 0
"the people demand reform in the administration of the government and the application of business principles to public affairs as a means to this end civilservice reform should be in good faith enforced our citizens have the right to protection from the incompetency of public employees who hold their places solely as the reward of partisan service and from the corrupting influence of those who promise and the vicious methods of those who expect such rewards and those who worthily seek public employment have the right to insist that merit and competency shall be recognized instead of party subserviency or the surrender of honest political belief" 	 1
"in the administration of a government pledged to do equal and exact justice to all men there should be no pretext for anxiety touching the protection of the freedmen in their rights or their security in the enjoyment of their privileges under the constitution and its amendments all discussion as to their fitness for the place accorded to them as american citizens is idle and unprofitable except as it suggests the necessity for their improvement the fact that they are citizens entitles them to all the rights due to that relation and charges them with all its duties obligations and responsibilities" 	 0
"these topics and the constant and evervarying wants of an active and enterprising population may well receive the attention and the patriotic endeavor of all who make and execute the federal law our duties are practical and call for industrious application an intelligent perception of the claims of public office and above all a firm determination by united action to secure to all the people of the land the full benefits of the best form of government ever vouchsafed to man and let us not trust to human effort alone but humbly acknowledging the power and goodness of almighty god who presides over the destiny of nations and who has at all times been revealed in our countrys history let us invoke his aid and his blessings upon our laborsfellowcitizens there is no constitutional or legal requirement that the president shall take the oath of office in the presence of the people but there is so manifest an appropriateness in the public induction to office of the chief executive officer of the nation that from the beginning of the government the people to whose service the official oath consecrates the officer have been called to witness the solemn ceremonial the oath taken in the presence of the people becomes a mutual covenant the officer covenants to serve the whole body of the people by a faithful execution of the laws so that they may be the unfailing defense and security of those who respect and observe them and that neither wealth station nor the power of combinations shall be able to evade their just penalties or to wrest them from a beneficent public purpose to serve the ends of cruelty or selfishness" 	 1
"my promise is spoken yours unspoken but not the less real and solemn the people of every state have here their representatives surely i do not misinterpret the spirit of the occasion when i assume that the whole body of the people covenant with me and with each other today to support and defend the constitution and the union of the states to yield willing obedience to all the laws and each to every other citizen his equal civil and political rights entering thus solemnly into covenant with each other we may reverently invoke and confidently expect the favor and help of almighty god  that he will give to me wisdom strength and fidelity and to our people a spirit of fraternity and a love of righteousness and peace" 	 0
"this occasion derives peculiar interest from the fact that the presidential term which begins this day is the twentysixth under our constitution the first inauguration of president washington took place in new york where congress was then sitting on the 30th day of april 1789 having been deferred by reason of delays attending the organization of the congress and the canvass of the electoral vote our people have already worthily observed the centennials of the declaration of independence of the battle of yorktown and of the adoption of the constitution and will shortly celebrate in new york the institution of the second great department of our constitutional scheme of government when the centennial of the institution of the judicial department by the organization of the supreme court shall have been suitably observed as i trust it will be our nation will have full entered its second century" 	 0
"i will not attempt to note the marvelous and in great part happy contrasts between our country as it steps over the threshold into its second century of organized existence under the constitution and that weak but wisely ordered young nation that looked undauntedly down the first century when all its years stretched out before it" 	 1
"our people will not fail at this time to recall the incidents which accompanied the institution of government under the constitution or to find inspiration and guidance in the teachings and example of washington and his great associates and hope and courage in the contrast which thirtyeight populous and prosperous states offer to the thirteen states weak in everything except courage and the love of liberty that then fringed our atlantic seaboard" 	 1
"the territory of dakota has now a population greater than any of the original states except virginia and greater than the aggregate of five of the smaller states in 1790 the center of population when our national capital was located was east of baltimore and it was argued by many wellinformed persons that it would move eastward rather than westward yet in 1880 it was found to be near cincinnati and the new census about to be taken will show another stride to the westward that which was the body has come to be only the rich fringe of the nations robe but our growth has not been limited to territory population and aggregate wealth marvelous as it has been in each of those directions the masses of our people are better fed clothed and housed than their fathers were the facilities for popular education have been vastly enlarged and more generally diffused" 	 0
"the virtues of courage and patriotism have given recent proof of their continued presence and increasing power in the hearts and over the lives of our people the influences of religion have been multiplied and strengthened the sweet offices of charity have greatly increased the virtue of temperance is held in higher estimation we have not attained an ideal condition not all of our people are happy and prosperous not all of them are virtuous and lawabiding but on the whole the opportunities offered to the individual to secure the comforts of life are better than are found elsewhere and largely better than they were here one hundred years ago" 	 0
"the surrender of a large measure of sovereignty to the general government effected by the adoption of the constitution was not accomplished until the suggestions of reason were strongly reenforced by the more imperative voice of experience the divergent interests of peace speedily demanded a more perfect union the merchant the shipmaster and the manufacturer discovered and disclosed to our statesmen and to the people that commercial emancipation must be added to the political freedom which had been so bravely won the commercial policy of the mother country had not relaxed any of its hard and oppressive features to hold in check the development of our commercial marine to prevent or retard the establishment and growth of manufactures in the states and so to secure the american market for their shops and the carrying trade for their ships was the policy of european statesmen and was pursued with the most selfish vigor" 	 0
"petitions poured in upon congress urging the imposition of discriminating duties that should encourage the production of needed things at home the patriotism of the people which no longer found afield of exercise in war was energetically directed to the duty of equipping the young republic for the defense of its independence by making its people selfdependent societies for the promotion of home manufactures and for encouraging the use of domestics in the dress of the people were organized in many of the states the revival at the end of the century of the same patriotic interest in the preservation and development of domestic industries and the defense of our working people against injurious foreign competition is an incident worthy of attention it is not a departure but a return that we have witnessed the protective policy had then its opponents the argument was made as now that its benefits inured to particular classes or sections" 	 1
"if the question became in any sense or at any time sectional it was only because slavery existed in some of the states but for this there was no reason why the cottonproducing states should not have led or walked abreast with the new england states in the production of cotton fabrics there was this reason only why the states that divide with pennsylvania the mineral treasures of the great southeastern and central mountain ranges should have been so tardy in bringing to the smelting furnace and to the mill the coal and iron from their near opposing hillsides mill fires were lighted at the funeral pile of slavery the emancipation proclamation was heard in the depths of the earth as well as in the sky men were made free and material things became our better servants" 	 1
"the sectional element has happily been eliminated from the tariff discussion we have no longer states that are necessarily only planting states none are excluded from achieving that diversification of pursuits among the people which brings wealth and contentment the cotton plantation will not be less valuable when the product is spun in the country town by operatives whose necessities call for diversified crops and create a home demand for garden and agricultural products every new mine furnace and factory is an extension of the productive capacity of the state more real and valuable than added territory" 	 1
"shall the prejudices and paralysis of slavery continue to hang upon the skirts of progress how long will those who rejoice that slavery no longer exists cherish or tolerate the incapacities it put upon their communities i look hopefully to the continuance of our protective system and to the consequent development of manufacturing and mining enterprises in the states hitherto wholly given to agriculture as a potent influence in the perfect unification of our people the men who have invested their capital in these enterprises the farmers who have felt the benefit of their neighborhood and the men who work in shop or field will not fail to find and to defend a community of interest" 	 0
"is it not quite possible that the farmers and the promoters of the great mining and manufacturing enterprises which have recently been established in the south may yet find that the free ballot of the workingman without distinction of race is needed for their defense as well as for his own i do not doubt that if those men in the south who now accept the tariff views of clay and the constitutional expositions of webster would courageously avow and defend their real convictions they would not find it difficult by friendly instruction and cooperation to make the black man their efficient and safe ally not only in establishing correct principles in our national administration but in preserving for their local communities the benefits of social order and economical and honest government at least until the good offices of kindness and education have been fairly tried the contrary conclusion can not be plausibly urged" 	 0
"i have altogether rejected the suggestion of a special executive policy for any section of our country it is the duty of the executive to administer and enforce in the methods and by the instrumentalities pointed out and provided by the constitution all the laws enacted by congress these laws are general and their administration should be uniform and equal as a citizen may not elect what laws he will obey neither may the executive eject which he will enforce the duty to obey and to execute embraces the constitution in its entirety and the whole code of laws enacted under it the evil example of permitting individuals corporations or communities to nullify the laws because they cross some selfish or local interest or prejudices is full of danger not only to the nation at large but much more to those who use this pernicious expedient to escape their just obligations or to obtain an unjust advantage over others they will presently themselves be compelled to appeal to the law for protection and those who would use the law as a defense must not deny that use of it to others" 	 0
"if our great corporations would more scrupulously observe their legal limitations and duties they would have less cause to complain of the unlawful limitations of their rights or of violent interference with their operations the community that by concert open or secret among its citizens denies to a portion of its members their plain rights under the law has severed the only safe bond of social order and prosperity the evil works from a bad center both ways it demoralizes those who practice it and destroys the faith of those who suffer by it in the efficiency of the law as a safe protector the man in whose breast that faith has been darkened is naturally the subject of dangerous and uncanny suggestions those who use unlawful methods if moved by no higher motive than the selfishness that prompted them may well stop and inquire what is to be the end of this" 	 0
"an unlawful expedient can not become a permanent condition of government if the educated and influential classes in a community either practice or connive at the systematic violation of laws that seem to them to cross their convenience what can they expect when the lesson that convenience or a supposed class interest is a sufficient cause for lawlessness has been well learned by the ignorant classes a community where law is the rule of conduct and where courts not mobs execute its penalties is the only attractive field for business investments and honest labor" 	 1
"our naturalization laws should be so amended as to make the inquiry into the character and good disposition of persons applying for citizenship more careful and searching our existing laws have been in their administration an unimpressive and often an unintelligible form we accept the man as a citizen without any knowledge of his fitness and he assumes the duties of citizenship without any knowledge as to what they are the privileges of american citizenship are so great and its duties so grave that we may well insist upon a good knowledge of every person applying for citizenship and a good knowledge by him of our institutions we should not cease to be hospitable to immigration but we should cease to be careless as to the character of it there are men of all races even the best whose coming is necessarily a burden upon our public revenues or a threat to social order these should be identified and excluded" 	 1
"we have happily maintained a policy of avoiding all interference with european affairs we have been only interested spectators of their contentions in diplomacy and in war ready to use our friendly offices to promote peace but never obtruding our advice and never attempting unfairly to coin the distresses of other powers into commercial advantage to ourselves we have a just right to expect that our european policy will be the american policy of european courts" 	 1
"it is so manifestly incompatible with those precautions for our peace and safety which all the great powers habitually observe and enforce in matters affecting them that a shorter waterway between our eastern and western seaboards should be dominated by any european government that we may confidently expect that such a purpose will not be entertained by any friendly power" 	 0
"we shall in the future as in the past use every endeavor to maintain and enlarge our friendly relations with all the great powers but they will not expect us to look kindly upon any project that would leave us subject to the dangers of a hostile observation or environment we have not sought to dominate or to absorb any of our weaker neighbors but rather to aid and encourage them to establish free and stable governments resting upon the consent of their own people we have a clear right to expect therefore that no european government will seek to establish colonial dependencies upon the territory of these independent american states that which a sense of justice restrains us from seeking they may be reasonably expected willingly to forego" 	 1
"it must not be assumed however that our interests are so exclusively american that our entire inattention to any events that may transpire elsewhere can be taken for granted our citizens domiciled for purposes of trade in all countries and in many of the islands of the sea demand and will have our adequate care in their personal and commercial rights the necessities of our navy require convenient coaling stations and dock and harbor privileges these and other trading privileges we will feel free to obtain only by means that do not in any degree partake of coercion however feeble the government from which we ask such concessions but having fairly obtained them by methods and for purposes entirely consistent with the most friendly disposition toward all other powers our consent will be necessary to any modification or impairment of the concession" 	 1
"we shall neither fail to respect the flag of any friendly nation or the just rights of its citizens nor to exact the like treatment for our own calmness justice and consideration should characterize our diplomacy the offices of an intelligent diplomacy or of friendly arbitration in proper cases should be adequate to the peaceful adjustment of all international difficulties by such methods we will make our contribution to the worlds peace which no nation values more highly and avoid the opprobrium which must fall upon the nation that ruthlessly breaks it" 	 0
"the duty devolved by law upon the president to nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate to appoint all public officers whose appointment is not otherwise provided for in the constitution or by act of congress has become very burdensome and its wise and efficient discharge full of difficulty the civil list is so large that a personal knowledge of any large number of the applicants is impossible the president must rely upon the representations of others and these are often made inconsiderately and without any just sense of responsibility i have a right i think to insist that those who volunteer or are invited to give advice as to appointments shall exercise consideration and fidelity a high sense of duty and an ambition to improve the service should characterize all public officers" 	 1
"there are many ways in which the convenience and comfort of those who have business with our public offices may be promoted by a thoughtful and obliging officer and i shall expect those whom i may appoint to justify their selection by a conspicuous efficiency in the discharge of their duties honorable party service will certainly not be esteemed by me a disqualification for public office but it will in no case be allowed to serve as a shield of official negligence incompetency or delinquency it is entirely creditable to seek public office by proper methods and with proper motives and all applicants will be treated with consideration but i shall need and the heads of departments will need time for inquiry and deliberation persistent importunity will not therefore be the best support of an application for office heads of departments bureaus and all other public officers having any duty connected therewith will be expected to enforce the civilservice law fully and without evasion beyond this obvious duty i hope to do something more to advance the reform of the civil service the ideal or even my own ideal i shall probably not attain retrospect will be a safer basis of judgment than promises we shall not however i am sure be able to put our civil service upon a nonpartisan basis until we have secured an incumbency that fairminded men of the opposition will approve for impartiality and integrity as the number of such in the civil list is increased removals from office will diminish" 	 0
"while a treasury surplus is not the greatest evil it is a serious evil our revenue should be ample to meet the ordinary annual demands upon our treasury with a sufficient margin for those extraordinary but scarcely less imperative demands which arise now and then expenditure should always be made with economy and only upon public necessity wastefulness profligacy or favoritism in public expenditures is criminal but there is nothing in the condition of our country or of our people to suggest that anything presently necessary to the public prosperity security or honor should be unduly postponed" 	 0
"it will be the duty of congress wisely to forecast and estimate these extraordinary demands and having added them to our ordinary expenditures to so adjust our revenue laws that no considerable annual surplus will remain we will fortunately be able to apply to the redemption of the public debt any small and unforeseen excess of revenue this is better than to reduce our income below our necessary expenditures with the resulting choice between another change of our revenue laws and an increase of the public debt it is quite possible i am sure to effect the necessary reduction in our revenues without breaking down our protective tariff or seriously injuring any domestic industry" 	 1
"the construction of a sufficient number of modern war ships and of their necessary armament should progress as rapidly as is consistent with care and perfection in plans and workmanship the spirit courage and skill of our naval officers and seamen have many times in our history given to weak ships and inefficient guns a rating greatly beyond that of the naval list that they will again do so upon occasion i do not doubt but they ought not by premeditation or neglect to be left to the risks and exigencies of an unequal combat we should encourage the establishment of american steamship lines the exchanges of commerce demand stated reliable and rapid means of communication and until these are provided the development of our trade with the states lying south of us is impossible" 	 0

"it is very gratifying to observe the general interest now being manifested in the reform of our election laws those who have been for years calling attention to the pressing necessity of throwing about the ballot box and about the elector further safeguards in order that our elections might not only be free and pure but might clearly appear to be so will welcome the accession of any who did not so soon discover the need of reform the national congress has not as yet taken control of elections in that case over which the constitution gives it jurisdiction but has accepted and adopted the election laws of the several states provided penalties for their violation and a method of supervision only the inefficiency of the state laws or an unfair partisan administration of them could suggest a departure from this policy" 	 0
"it was clearly however in the contemplation of the framers of the constitution that such an exigency might arise and provision was wisely made for it the freedom of the ballot is a condition of our national life and no power vested in congress or in the executive to secure or perpetuate it should remain unused upon occasion the people of all the congressional districts have an equal interest that the election in each shall truly express the views and wishes of a majority of the qualified electors residing within it the results of such elections are not local and the insistence of electors residing in other districts that they shall be pure and free does not savor at all of impertinence" 	 1
"if in any of the states the public security is thought to be threatened by ignorance among the electors the obvious remedy is education the sympathy and help of our people will not be withheld from any community struggling with special embarrassments or difficulties connected with the suffrage if the remedies proposed proceed upon lawful lines and are promoted by just and honorable methods how shall those who practice election frauds recover that respect for the sanctity of the ballot which is the first condition and obligation of good citizenship the man who has come to regard the ballot box as a jugglers hat has renounced his allegiance" 	 1
"let us exalt patriotism and moderate our party contentions let those who would die for the flag on the field of battle give a better proof of their patriotism and a higher glory to their country by promoting fraternity and justice a party success that is achieved by unfair methods or by practices that partake of revolution is hurtful and evanescent even from a party standpoint we should hold our differing opinions in mutual respect and having submitted them to the arbitrament of the ballot should accept an adverse judgment with the same respect that we would have demanded of our opponents if the decision had been in our favor" 	 1
"no other people have a government more worthy of their respect and love or a land so magnificent in extent so pleasant to look upon and so full of generous suggestion to enterprise and labor god has placed upon our head a diadem and has laid at our feet power and wealth beyond definition or calculation but we must not forget that we take these gifts upon the condition that justice and mercy shall hold the reins of power and that the upward avenues of hope shall be free to all the people" 	 1

"while every american citizen must contemplate with the utmost pride and enthusiasm the growth and expansion of our country the sufficiency of our institutions to stand against the rudest shocks of violence the wonderful thrift and enterprise of our people and the demonstrated superiority of our free government it behooves us to constantly watch for every symptom of insidious infirmity that threatens our national vigor" 	 0

"manifestly nothing is more vital to our supremacy as a nation and to the beneficent purposes of our government than a sound and stable currency its exposure to degradation should at once arouse to activity the most enlightened statesmanship and the danger of depreciation in the purchasing power of the wages paid to toil should furnish the strongest incentive to prompt and conservative precaution" 	 1
"in dealing with our present embarrassing situation as related to this subject we will be wise if we temper our confidence and faith in our national strength and resources with the frank concession that even these will not permit us to defy with impunity the inexorable laws of finance and trade at the same time in our efforts to adjust differences of opinion we should be free from intolerance or passion and our judgments should be unmoved by alluring phrases and unvexed by selfish interests" 	 0
"i am confident that such an approach to the subject will result in prudent and effective remedial legislation in the meantime so far as the executive branch of the government can intervene none of the powers with which it is invested will be withheld when their exercise is deemed necessary to maintain our national credit or avert financial disaster" 	 0

"the verdict of our voters which condemned the injustice of maintaining protection for protections sake enjoins upon the peoples servants the duty of exposing and destroying the brood of kindred evils which are the unwholesome progeny of paternalism this is the bane of republican institutions and the constant peril of our government by the people it degrades to the purposes of wily craft the plan of rule our fathers established and bequeathed to us as an object of our love and veneration it perverts the patriotic sentiments of our countrymen and tempts them to pitiful calculation of the sordid gain to be derived from their governments maintenance it undermines the selfreliance of our people and substitutes in its place dependence upon governmental favoritism it stifles the spirit of true americanism and stupefies every ennobling trait of american citizenship" 	 0
"the lessons of paternalism ought to be unlearned and the better lesson taught that while the people should patriotically and cheerfully support their government its functions do not include the support of the people" 	 0
"the acceptance of this principle leads to a refusal of bounties and subsidies which burden the labor and thrift of a portion of our citizens to aid illadvised or languishing enterprises in which they have no concern it leads also to a challenge of wild and reckless pension expenditure which overleaps the bounds of grateful recognition of patriotic service and prostitutes to vicious uses the peoples prompt and generous impulse to aid those disabled in their countrys defense" 	 1
"every thoughtful american must realize the importance of checking at its beginning any tendency in public or private station to regard frugality and economy as virtues which we may safely outgrow the toleration of this idea results in the waste of the peoples money by their chosen servants and encourages prodigality and extravagance in the home life of our countrymen" 	 0
"under our scheme of government the waste of public money is a crime against the citizen and the contempt of our people for economy and frugality in their personal affairs deplorably saps the strength and sturdiness of our national character" 	 0
"it is a plain dictate of honesty and good government that public expenditures should be limited by public necessity and that this should be measured by the rules of strict economy and it is equally clear that frugality among the people is the best guaranty of a contented and strong support of free institutions" 	 0
"one mode of the misappropriation of public funds is avoided when appointments to office instead of being the rewards of partisan activity are awarded to those whose efficiency promises a fair return of work for the compensation paid to them to secure the fitness and competency of appointees to office and remove from political action the demoralizing madness for spoils civilservice reform has found a place in our public policy and laws the benefits already gained through this instrumentality and the further usefulness it promises entitle it to the hearty support and encouragement of all who desire to see our public service well performed or who hope for the elevation of political sentiment and the purification of political methods" 	 1
"the existence of immense aggregations of kindred enterprises and combinations of business interests formed for the purpose of limiting production and fixing prices is inconsistent with the fair field which ought to be open to every independent activity legitimate strife in business should not be superseded by an enforced concession to the demands of combinations that have the power to destroy nor should the people to be served lose the benefit of cheapness which usually results from wholesome competition these aggregations and combinations frequently constitute conspiracies against the interests of the people and in all their phases they are unnatural and opposed to our american sense of fairness to the extent that they can be reached and restrained by federal power the general government should relieve our citizens from their interference and exactions" 	 1
"loyalty to the principles upon which our government rests positively demands that the equality before the law which it guarantees to every citizen should be justly and in good faith conceded in all parts of the land the enjoyment of this right follows the badge of citizenship wherever found and unimpaired by race or color it appeals for recognition to american manliness and fairness" 	 1
"our relations with the indians located within our border impose upon us responsibilities we can not escape humanity and consistency require us to treat them with forbearance and in our dealings with them to honestly and considerately regard their rights and interests every effort should be made to lead them through the paths of civilization and education to selfsupporting and independent citizenship in the meantime as the nations wards they should be promptly defended against the cupidity of designing men and shielded from every influence or temptation that retards their advancement" 	 0
"the people of the united states have decreed that on this day the control of their government in its legislative and executive branches shall be given to a political party pledged in the most positive terms to the accomplishment of tariff reform they have thus determined in favor of a more just and equitable system of federal taxation the agents they have chosen to carry out their purposes are bound by their promises not less than by the command of their masters to devote themselves unremittingly to this service" 	 1
"while there should be no surrender of principle our task must be undertaken wisely and without heedless vindictiveness our mission is not punishment but the rectification of wrong if in lifting burdens from the daily life of our people we reduce inordinate and unequal advantages too long enjoyed this is but a necessary incident of our return to right and justice if we exact from unwilling minds acquiescence in the theory of an honest distribution of the fund of the governmental beneficence treasured up for all we but insist upon a principle which underlies our free institutions when we tear aside the delusions and misconceptions which have blinded our countrymen to their condition under vicious tariff laws we but show them how far they have been led away from the paths of contentment and prosperity when we proclaim that the necessity for revenue to support the government furnishes the only justification for taxing the people we announce a truth so plain that its denial would seem to indicate the extent to which judgment may be influenced by familiarity with perversions of the taxing power and when we seek to reinstate the selfconfidence and business enterprise of our citizens by discrediting an abject dependence upon governmental favor we strive to stimulate those elements of american character which support the hope of american achievement" 	 1
"anxiety for the redemption of the pledges which my party has made and solicitude for the complete justification of the trust the people have reposed in us constrain me to remind those with whom i am to cooperate that we can succeed in doing the work which has been especially set before us only by the most sincere harmonious and disinterested effort even if insuperable obstacles and opposition prevent the consummation of our task we shall hardly be excused and if failure can be traced to our fault or neglect we may be sure the people will hold us to a swift and exacting accountability" 	 0

"the responsibilities of the high trust to which i have been called  always of grave importance  are augmented by the prevailing business conditions entailing idleness upon willing labor and loss to useful enterprises the country is suffering from industrial disturbances from which speedy relief must be had our financial system needs some revision our money is all good now but its value must not further be threatened it should all be put upon an enduring basis not subject to easy attack nor its stability to doubt or dispute our currency should continue under the supervision of the government the several forms of our paper money offer in my judgment a constant embarrassment to the government and a safe balance in the treasury therefore i believe it necessary to devise a system which without diminishing the circulating medium or offering a premium for its contraction will present a remedy for those arrangements which temporary in their nature might well in the years of our prosperity have been displaced by wiser provisions with adequate revenue secured but not until then we can enter upon such changes in our fiscal laws as will while insuring safety and volume to our money no longer impose upon the government the necessity of maintaining so large a gold reserve with its attendant and inevitable temptations to speculation most of our financial laws are the outgrowth of experience and trial and should not be amended without investigation and demonstration of the wisdom of the proposed changes we must be both sure we are right and make haste slowly if therefore congress in its wisdom shall deem it expedient to create a commission to take under early consideration the revision of our coinage banking and currency laws and give them that exhaustive careful and dispassionate examination that their importance demands i shall cordially concur in such action if such power is vested in the president it is my purpose to appoint a commission of prominent wellinformed citizens of different parties who will command public confidence both on account of their ability and special fitness for the work business experience and public training may thus be combined and the patriotic zeal of the friends of the country be so directed that such a report will be made as to receive the support of all parties and our finances cease to be the subject of mere partisan contention the experiment is at all events worth a trial and in my opinion it can but prove beneficial to the entire country" 	 1
"the question of international bimetallism will have early and earnest attention it will be my constant endeavor to secure it by cooperation with the other great commercial powers of the world until that condition is realized when the parity between our gold and silver money springs from and is supported by the relative value of the two metals the value of the silver already coined and of that which may hereafter be coined must be kept constantly at par with gold by every resource at our command the credit of the government the integrity of its currency and the inviolability of its obligations must be preserved this was the commanding verdict of the people and it will not be unheeded" 	 0
"economy is demanded in every branch of the government at all times but especially in periods like the present of depression in business and distress among the people the severest economy must be observed in all public expenditures and extravagance stopped wherever it is found and prevented wherever in the future it may be developed if the revenues are to remain as now the only relief that can come must be from decreased expenditures but the present must not become the permanent condition of the government it has been our uniform practice to retire not increase our outstanding obligations and this policy must again be resumed and vigorously enforced our revenues should always be large enough to meet with ease and promptness not only our current needs and the principal and interest of the public debt but to make proper and liberal provision for that most deserving body of public creditors the soldiers and sailors and the widows and orphans who are the pensioners of the united states" 	 1
"the government should not be permitted to run behind or increase its debt in times like the present suitably to provide against this is the mandate of duty  the certain and easy remedy for most of our financial difficulties a deficiency is inevitable so long as the expenditures of the government exceed its receipts it can only be met by loans or an increased revenue while a large annual surplus of revenue may invite waste and extravagance inadequate revenue creates distrust and undermines public and private credit neither should be encouraged between more loans and more revenue there ought to be but one opinion we should have more revenue and that without delay hindrance or postponement a surplus in the treasury created by loans is not a permanent or safe reliance it will suffice while it lasts but it can not last long while the outlays of the government are greater than its receipts as has been the case during the past two years nor must it be forgotten that however much such loans may temporarily relieve the situation the government is still indebted for the amount of the surplus thus accrued which it must ultimately pay while its ability to pay is not strengthened but weakened by a continued deficit loans are imperative in great emergencies to preserve the government or its credit but a failure to supply needed revenue in time of peace for the maintenance of either has no justification" 	 1
"the best way for the government to maintain its credit is to pay as it goes  not by resorting to loans but by keeping out of debt  through an adequate income secured by a system of taxation external or internal or both it is the settled policy of the government pursued from the beginning and practiced by all parties and administrations to raise the bulk of our revenue from taxes upon foreign productions entering the united states for sale and consumption and avoiding for the most part every form of direct taxation except in time of war the country is clearly opposed to any needless additions to the subject of internal taxation and is committed by its latest popular utterance to the system of tariff taxation there can be no misunderstanding either about the principle upon which this tariff taxation shall be levied nothing has ever been made plainer at a general election than that the controlling principle in the raising of revenue from duties on imports is zealous care for american interests and american labor the people have declared that such legislation should be had as will give ample protection and encouragement to the industries and the development of our country it is therefore earnestly hoped and expected that congress will at the earliest practicable moment enact revenue legislation that shall be fair reasonable conservative and just and which while supplying sufficient revenue for public purposes will still be signally beneficial and helpful to every section and every enterprise of the people to this policy we are all of whatever party firmly bound by the voice of the people  a power vastly more potential than the expression of any political platform the paramount duty of congress is to stop deficiencies by the restoration of that protective legislation which has always been the firmest prop of the treasury the passage of such a law or laws would strengthen the credit of the government both at home and abroad and go far toward stopping the drain upon the gold reserve held for the redemption of our currency which has been heavy and wellnigh constant for several years" 	 0
"in the revision of the tariff especial attention should be given to the reenactment and extension of the reciprocity principle of the law of 1890 under which so great a stimulus was given to our foreign trade in new and advantageous markets for our surplus agricultural and manufactured products the brief trial given this legislation amply justifies a further experiment and additional discretionary power in the making of commercial treaties the end in view always to be the opening up of new markets for the products of our country by granting concessions to the products of other lands that we need and cannot produce ourselves and which do not involve any loss of labor to our own people but tend to increase their employment" 	 0
"the depression of the past four years has fallen with especial severity upon the great body of toilers of the country and upon none more than the holders of small farms agriculture has languished and labor suffered the revival of manufacturing will be a relief to both no portion of our population is more devoted to the institution of free government nor more loyal in their support while none bears more cheerfully or fully its proper share in the maintenance of the government or is better entitled to its wise and liberal care and protection legislation helpful to producers is beneficial to all the depressed condition of industry on the farm and in the mine and factory has lessened the ability of the people to meet the demands upon them and they rightfully expect that not only a system of revenue shall be established that will secure the largest income with the least burden but that every means will be taken to decrease rather than increase our public expenditures business conditions are not the most promising it will take time to restore the prosperity of former years if we cannot promptly attain it we can resolutely turn our faces in that direction and aid its return by friendly legislation however troublesome the situation may appear congress will not i am sure be found lacking in disposition or ability to relieve it as far as legislation can do so the restoration of confidence and the revival of business which men of all parties so much desire depend more largely upon the prompt energetic and intelligent action of congress than upon any other single agency affecting the situation" 	 1
"it is inspiring too to remember that no great emergency in the one hundred and eight years of our eventful national life has ever arisen that has not been met with wisdom and courage by the american people with fidelity to their best interests and highest destiny and to the honor of the american name these years of glorious history have exalted mankind and advanced the cause of freedom throughout the world and immeasurably strengthened the precious free institutions which we enjoy the people love and will sustain these institutions the great essential to our happiness and prosperity is that we adhere to the principles upon which the government was established and insist upon their faithful observance equality of rights must prevail and our laws be always and everywhere respected and obeyed we may have failed in the discharge of our full duty as citizens of the great republic but it is consoling and encouraging to realize that free speech a free press free thought free schools the free and unmolested right of religious liberty and worship and free and fair elections are dearer and more universally enjoyed today than ever before these guaranties must be sacredly preserved and wisely strengthened the constituted authorities must be cheerfully and vigorously upheld lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the united states courts not mobs must execute the penalties of the law the preservation of public order the right of discussion the integrity of courts and the orderly administration of justice must continue forever the rock of safety upon which our government securely rests" 	 1
"one of the lessons taught by the late election which all can rejoice in is that the citizens of the united states are both lawrespecting and lawabiding people not easily swerved from the path of patriotism and honor this is in entire accord with the genius of our institutions and but emphasizes the advantages of inculcating even a greater love for law and order in the future immunity should be granted to none who violate the laws whether individuals corporations or communities and as the constitution imposes upon the president the duty of both its own execution and of the statutes enacted in pursuance of its provisions i shall endeavor carefully to carry them into effect the declaration of the party now restored to power has been in the past that of opposition to all combinations of capital organized in trusts or otherwise to control arbitrarily the condition of trade among our citizens and it has supported such legislation as will prevent the execution of all schemes to oppress the people by undue charges on their supplies or by unjust rates for the transportation of their products to the market this purpose will be steadily pursued both by the enforcement of the laws now in existence and the recommendation and support of such new statutes as may be necessary to carry it into effect" 	 1
"our naturalization and immigration laws should be further improved to the constant promotion of a safer a better and a higher citizenship a grave peril to the republic would be a citizenship too ignorant to understand or too vicious to appreciate the great value and beneficence of our institutions and laws and against all who come here to make war upon them our gates must be promptly and tightly closed nor must we be unmindful of the need of improvement among our own citizens but with the zeal of our forefathers encourage the spread of knowledge and free education illiteracy must be banished from the land if we shall attain that high destiny as the foremost of the enlightened nations of the world which under providence we ought to achieve" 	 1

"congress should give prompt attention to the restoration of our american merchant marine once the pride of the seas in all the great ocean highways of commerce to my mind few more important subjects so imperatively demand its intelligent consideration the united states has progressed with marvelous rapidity in every field of enterprise and endeavor until we have become foremost in nearly all the great lines of inland trade commerce and industry yet while this is true our american merchant marine has been steadily declining until it is now lower both in the percentage of tonnage and the number of vessels employed than it was prior to the civil war commendable progress has been made of late years in the upbuilding of the american navy but we must supplement these efforts by providing as a proper consort for it a merchant marine amply sufficient for our own carrying trade to foreign countries the question is one that appeals both to our business necessities and the patriotic aspirations of a great people" 	 1
"it has been the policy of the united states since the foundation of the government to cultivate relations of peace and amity with all the nations of the world and this accords with my conception of our duty now we have cherished the policy of noninterference with affairs of foreign governments wisely inaugurated by washington keeping ourselves free from entanglement either as allies or foes content to leave undisturbed with them the settlement of their own domestic concerns it will be our aim to pursue a firm and dignified foreign policy which shall be just impartial ever watchful of our national honor and always insisting upon the enforcement of the lawful rights of american citizens everywhere our diplomacy should seek nothing more and accept nothing less than is due us we want no wars of conquest we must avoid the temptation of territorial aggression war should never be entered upon until every agency of peace has failed peace is preferable to war in almost every contingency arbitration is the true method of settlement of international as well as local or individual differences it was recognized as the best means of adjustment of differences between employers and employees by the fortyninth congress in 1886 and its application was extended to our diplomatic relations by the unanimous concurrence of the senate and house of the fiftyfirst congress in 1890 the latter resolution was accepted as the basis of negotiations with us by the british house of commons in 1893 and upon our invitation a treaty of arbitration between the united states and great britain was signed at washington and transmitted to the senate for its ratification in january last since this treaty is clearly the result of our own initiative since it has been recognized as the leading feature of our foreign policy throughout our entire history  the adjustment of difficulties by judicial methods rather than force of arms  and since it presents to the world the glorious example of reason and peace not passion and war controlling the relations between two of the greatest nations in the world an example certain to be followed by others i respectfully urge the early action of the senate thereon not merely as a matter of policy but as a duty to mankind the importance and moral influence of the ratification of such a treaty can hardly be overestimated in the cause of advancing civilization it may well engage the best thought of the statesmen and people of every country and i cannot but consider it fortunate that it was reserved to the united states to have the leadership in so grand a work" 	 1
"it has been the uniform practice of each president to avoid as far as possible the convening of congress in extraordinary session it is an example which under ordinary circumstances and in the absence of a public necessity is to be commended but a failure to convene the representatives of the people in congress in extra session when it involves neglect of a public duty places the responsibility of such neglect upon the executive himself the condition of the public treasury as has been indicated demands the immediate consideration of congress it alone has the power to provide revenues for the government not to convene it under such circumstances i can view in no other sense than the neglect of a plain duty i do not sympathize with the sentiment that congress in session is dangerous to our general business interests its members are the agents of the people and their presence at the seat of government in the execution of the sovereign will should not operate as an injury but a benefit there could be no better time to put the government upon a sound financial and economic basis than now the people have only recently voted that this should be done and nothing is more binding upon the agents of their will than the obligation of immediate action it has always seemed to me that the postponement of the meeting of congress until more than a year after it has been chosen deprived congress too often of the inspiration of the popular will and the country of the corresponding benefits it is evident therefore that to postpone action in the presence of so great a necessity would be unwise on the part of the executive because unjust to the interests of the people our action now will be freer from mere partisan consideration than if the question of tariff revision was postponed until the regular session of congress we are nearly two years from a congressional election and politics cannot so greatly distract us as if such contest was immediately pending we can approach the problem calmly and patriotically without fearing its effect upon an early election" 	 0
"our fellowcitizens who may disagree with us upon the character of this legislation prefer to have the question settled now even against their preconceived views and perhaps settled so reasonably as i trust and believe it will be as to insure great permanence than to have further uncertainty menacing the vast and varied business interests of the united states again whatever action congress may take will be given a fair opportunity for trial before the people are called to pass judgment upon it and this i consider a great essential to the rightful and lasting settlement of the question in view of these considerations i shall deem it my duty as president to convene congress in extraordinary session on monday the 15th day of march 1897" 	 1
"in conclusion i congratulate the country upon the fraternal spirit of the people and the manifestations of good will everywhere so apparent the recent election not only most fortunately demonstrated the obliteration of sectional or geographical lines but to some extent also the prejudices which for years have distracted our councils and marred our true greatness as a nation the triumph of the people whose verdict is carried into effect today is not the triumph of one section nor wholly of one party but of all sections and all the people the north and the south no longer divide on the old lines but upon principles and policies and in this fact surely every lover of the country can find cause for true felicitation" 	 1
"let us rejoice in and cultivate this spirit it is ennobling and will be both a gain and a blessing to our beloved country it will be my constant aim to do nothing and permit nothing to be done that will arrest or disturb this growing sentiment of unity and cooperation this revival of esteem and affiliation which now animates so many thousands in both the old antagonistic sections but i shall cheerfully do everything possible to promote and increase it let me again repeat the words of the oath administered by the chief justice which in their respective spheres so far as applicable i would have all my countrymen observe i will faithfully execute the office of president of the united states and will to the best of my ability preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states this is the obligation i have reverently taken before the lord most high to keep it will be my single purpose my constant prayer and i shall confidently rely upon the forbearance and assistance of all the people in the discharge of my solemn responsibilitiesmy fellowcitizens when we assembled here on the 4th of march 1897 there was great anxiety with regard to our currency and credit none exists now then our treasury receipts were inadequate to meet the current obligations of the government now they are sufficient for all public needs and we have a surplus instead of a deficit then i felt constrained to convene the congress in extraordinary session to devise revenues to pay the ordinary expenses of the government now i have the satisfaction to announce that the congress just closed has reduced taxation in the sum of 41000000 then there was deep solicitude because of the long depression in our manufacturing mining agricultural and mercantile industries and the consequent distress of our laboring population now every avenue of production is crowded with activity labor is well employed and american products find good markets at home and abroad" 	 1
"our diversified productions however are increasing in such unprecedented volume as to admonish us of the necessity of still further enlarging our foreign markets by broader commercial relations for this purpose reciprocal trade arrangements with other nations should in liberal spirit be carefully cultivated and promoted" 	 1
"the national verdict of 1896 has for the most part been executed whatever remains unfulfilled is a continuing obligation resting with undiminished force upon the executive and the congress but fortunate as our condition is its permanence can only be assured by sound business methods and strict economy in national administration and legislation we should not permit our great prosperity to lead us to reckless ventures in business or profligacy in public expenditures while the congress determines the objects and the sum of appropriations the officials of the executive departments are responsible for honest and faithful disbursement and it should be their constant care to avoid waste and extravagance" 	 0

"four years ago we stood on the brink of war without the people knowing it and without any preparation or effort at preparation for the impending peril i did all that in honor could be done to avert the war but without avail it became inevitable and the congress at its first regular session without party division provided money in anticipation of the crisis and in preparation to meet it it came the result was signally favorable to american arms and in the highest degree honorable to the government it imposed upon us obligations from which we cannot escape and from which it would be dishonorable to seek escape we are now at peace with the world and it is my fervent prayer that if differences arise between us and other powers they may be settled by peaceful arbitration and that hereafter we may be spared the horrors of war" 	 1
"intrusted by the people for a second time with the office of president i enter upon its administration appreciating the great responsibilities which attach to this renewed honor and commission promising unreserved devotion on my part to their faithful discharge and reverently invoking for my guidance the direction and favor of almighty god i should shrink from the duties this day assumed if i did not feel that in their performance i should have the cooperation of the wise and patriotic men of all parties it encourages me for the great task which i now undertake to believe that those who voluntarily committed to me the trust imposed upon the chief executive of the republic will give to me generous support in my duties to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states and to care that the laws be faithfully executed the national purpose is indicated through a national election it is the constitutional method of ascertaining the public will when once it is registered it is a law to us all and faithful observance should follow its decrees" 	 1

"we will be consoled to with the fact that opposition has confronted every onward movement of the republic from its opening hour until now but without success the republic has marched on and on and its step has exalted freedom and humanity we are undergoing the same ordeal as did our predecessors nearly a century ago we are following the course they blazed they triumphed will their successors falter and plead organic impotency in the nation surely after 125 years of achievement for mankind we will not now surrender our equality with other powers on matters fundamental and essential to nationality with no such purpose was the nation created in no such spirit has it developed its full and independent sovereignty we adhere to the principle of equality among ourselves and by no act of ours will we assign to ourselves a subordinate rank in the family of nations" 	 1
"my fellowcitizens the public events of the past four years have gone into history they are too near to justify recital some of them were unforeseen many of them momentous and farreaching in their consequences to ourselves and our relations with the rest of the world the part which the united states bore so honorably in the thrilling scenes in china while new to american life has been in harmony with its true spirit and best traditions and in dealing with the results its policy will be that of moderation and fairness" 	 0
"we face at this moment a most important question that of the future relations of the united states and cuba with our near neighbors we must remain close friends the declaration of the purposes of this government in the resolution of april 20 1898 must be made good ever since the evacuation of the island by the army of spain the executive with all practicable speed has been assisting its people in the successive steps necessary to the establishment of a free and independent government prepared to assume and perform the obligations of international law which now rest upon the united states under the treaty of paris the convention elected by the people to frame a constitution is approaching the completion of its labors the transfer of american control to the new government is of such great importance involving an obligation resulting from our intervention and the treaty of peace that i am glad to be advised by the recent act of congress of the policy which the legislative branch of the government deems essential to the best interests of cuba and the united states the principles which led to our intervention require that the fundamental law upon which the new government rests should be adapted to secure a government capable of performing the duties and discharging the functions of a separate nation of observing its international obligations of protecting life and property insuring order safety and liberty and conforming to the established and historical policy of the united states in its relation to cuba" 	 1

"while the treaty of peace with spain was ratified on the 6th of february 1899 and ratifications were exchanged nearly two years ago the congress has indicated no form of government for the philippine islands it has however provided an army to enable the executive to suppress insurrection restore peace give security to the inhabitants and establish the authority of the united states throughout the archipelago it has authorized the organization of native troops as auxiliary to the regular force it has been advised from time to time of the acts of the military and naval officers in the islands of my action in appointing civil commissions of the instructions with which they were charged of their duties and powers of their recommendations and of their several acts under executive commission together with the very complete general information they have submitted these reports fully set forth the conditions past and present in the islands and the instructions clearly show the principles which will guide the executive until the congress shall as it is required to do by the treaty determine the civil rights and political status of the native inhabitants the congress having added the sanction of its authority to the powers already possessed and exercised by the executive under the constitution thereby leaving with the executive the responsibility for the government of the philippines i shall continue the efforts already begun until order shall be restored throughout the islands and as fast as conditions permit will establish local governments in the formation of which the full cooperation of the people has been already invited and when established will encourage the people to administer them the settled purpose long ago proclaimed to afford the inhabitants of the islands selfgovernment as fast as they were ready for it will be pursued with earnestness and fidelity already something has been accomplished in this direction the governments representatives civil and military are doing faithful and noble work in their mission of emancipation and merit the approval and support of their countrymen the most liberal terms of amnesty have already been communicated to the insurgents and the way is still open for those who have raised their arms against the government for honorable submission to its authority our countrymen should not be deceived we are not waging war against the inhabitants of the philippine islands a portion of them are making war against the united states by far the greater part of the inhabitants recognize american sovereignty and welcome it as a guaranty of order and of security for life property liberty freedom of conscience and the pursuit of happiness to them full protection will be given they shall not be abandoned we will not leave the destiny of the loyal millions the islands to the disloyal thousands who are in rebellion against the united states order under civil institutions will come as soon as those who now break the peace shall keep it force will not be needed or used when those who make war against us shall make it no more may it end without further bloodshed and there be ushered in the reign of peace to be made permanent by a government of liberty under lawmy fellow citizens no people on earth have more cause to be thankful than ours and this is said reverently in no spirit of boastfulness in our own strength but with gratitude to the giver of good who has blessed us with the conditions which have enabled us to achieve so large a measure of wellbeing and of happiness to us as a people it has been granted to lay the foundations of our national life in a new continent we are the heirs of the ages and yet we have had to pay few of the penalties which in old countries are exacted by the dead hand of a bygone civilization we have not been obliged to fight for our existence against any alien race and yet our life has called for the vigor and effort without which the manlier and hardier virtues wither away under such conditions it would be our own fault if we failed and the success which we have had in the past the success which we confidently believe the future will bring should cause in us no feeling of vainglory but rather a deep and abiding realization of all which life has offered us a full acknowledgment of the responsibility which is ours and a fixed determination to show that under a free government a mighty people can thrive best alike as regards the things of the body and the things of the soul" 	 1
"much has been given us and much will rightfully be expected from us we have duties to others and duties to ourselves and we can shirk neither we have become a great nation forced by the fact of its greatness into relations with the other nations of the earth and we must behave as beseems a people with such responsibilities toward all other nations large and small our attitude must be one of cordial and sincere friendship we must show not only in our words but in our deeds that we are earnestly desirous of securing their good will by acting toward them in a spirit of just and generous recognition of all their rights but justice and generosity in a nation as in an individual count most when shown not by the weak but by the strong while ever careful to refrain from wrongdoing others we must be no less insistent that we are not wronged ourselves we wish peace but we wish the peace of justice the peace of righteousness we wish it because we think it is right and not because we are afraid no weak nation that acts manfully and justly should ever have cause to fear us and no strong power should ever be able to single us out as a subject for insolent aggression" 	 1
"our relations with the other powers of the world are important but still more important are our relations among ourselves such growth in wealth in population and in power as this nation has seen during the century and a quarter of its national life is inevitably accompanied by a like growth in the problems which are ever before every nation that rises to greatness power invariably means both responsibility and danger our forefathers faced certain perils which we have outgrown we now face other perils the very existence of which it was impossible that they should foresee modern life is both complex and intense and the tremendous changes wrought by the extraordinary industrial development of the last half century are felt in every fiber of our social and political being never before have men tried so vast and formidable an experiment as that of administering the affairs of a continent under the forms of a democratic republic the conditions which have told for our marvelous material wellbeing which have developed to a very high degree our energy selfreliance and individual initiative have also brought the care and anxiety inseparable from the accumulation of great wealth in industrial centers upon the success of our experiment much depends not only as regards our own welfare but as regards the welfare of mankind if we fail the cause of free selfgovernment throughout the world will rock to its foundations and therefore our responsibility is heavy to ourselves to the world as it is today and to the generations yet unborn there is no good reason why we should fear the future but there is every reason why we should face it seriously neither hiding from ourselves the gravity of the problems before us nor fearing to approach these problems with the unbending unflinching purpose to solve them aright" 	 0
"yet after all though the problems are new though the tasks set before us differ from the tasks set before our fathers who founded and preserved this republic the spirit in which these tasks must be undertaken and these problems faced if our duty is to be well done remains essentially unchanged we know that selfgovernment is difficult we know that no people needs such high traits of character as that people which seeks to govern its affairs aright through the freely expressed will of the freemen who compose it but we have faith that we shall not prove false to the memories of the men of the mighty past they did their work they left us the splendid heritage we now enjoy we in our turn have an assured confidence that we shall be able to leave this heritage unwasted and enlarged to our children and our childrens children to do so we must show not merely in great crises but in the everyday affairs of life the qualities of practical intelligence of courage of hardihood and endurance and above all the power of devotion to a lofty ideal which made great the men who founded this republic in the days of washington which made great the men who preserved this republic in the days of abraham lincolnmy fellow citizens anyone who has taken the oath i have just taken must feel a heavy weight of responsibility if not he has no conception of the powers and duties of the office upon which he is about to enter or he is lacking in a proper sense of the obligation which the oath imposes" 	 0
"the office of an inaugural address is to give a summary outline of the main policies of the new administration so far as they can be anticipated i have had the honor to be one of the advisers of my distinguished predecessor and as such to hold up his hands in the reforms he has initiated i should be untrue to myself to my promises and to the declarations of the party platform upon which i was elected to office if i did not make the maintenance and enforcement of those reforms a most important feature of my administration they were directed to the suppression of the lawlessness and abuses of power of the great combinations of capital invested in railroads and in industrial enterprises carrying on interstate commerce the steps which my predecessor took and the legislation passed on his recommendation have accomplished much have caused a general halt in the vicious policies which created popular alarm and have brought about in the business affected a much higher regard for existing law" 	 1
"to render the reforms lasting however and to secure at the same time freedom from alarm on the part of those pursuing proper and progressive business methods further legislative and executive action are needed relief of the railroads from certain restrictions of the antitrust law have been urged by my predecessor and will be urged by me on the other hand the administration is pledged to legislation looking to a proper federal supervision and restriction to prevent excessive issues of bonds and stock by companies owning and operating interstate commerce railroads" 	 0
"then too a reorganization of the department of justice of the bureau of corporations in the department of commerce and labor and of the interstate commerce commission looking to effective cooperation of these agencies is needed to secure a more rapid and certain enforcement of the laws affecting interstate railroads and industrial combinations" 	 1
"i hope to be able to submit at the first regular session of the incoming congress in december next definite suggestions in respect to the needed amendments to the antitrust and the interstate commerce law and the changes required in the executive departments concerned in their enforcement" 	 1
"it is believed that with the changes to be recommended american business can be assured of that measure of stability and certainty in respect to those things that may be done and those that are prohibited which is essential to the life and growth of all business such a plan must include the right of the people to avail themselves of those methods of combining capital and effort deemed necessary to reach the highest degree of economic efficiency at the same time differentiating between combinations based upon legitimate economic reasons and those formed with the intent of creating monopolies and artificially controlling prices" 	 0
"the work of formulating into practical shape such changes is creative word of the highest order and requires all the deliberation possible in the interval i believe that the amendments to be proposed are just as necessary in the protection of legitimate business as in the clinching of the reforms which properly bear the name of my predecessor" 	 0
"a matter of most pressing importance is the revision of the tariff in accordance with the promises of the platform upon which i was elected i shall call congress into extra session to meet on the 15th day of march in order that consideration may be at once given to a bill revising the dingley act this should secure an adequate revenue and adjust the duties in such a manner as to afford to labor and to all industries in this country whether of the farm mine or factory protection by tariff equal to the difference between the cost of production abroad and the cost of production here and have a provision which shall put into force upon executive determination of certain facts a higher or maximum tariff against those countries whose trade policy toward us equitably requires such discrimination it is thought that there has been such a change in conditions since the enactment of the dingley act drafted on a similarly protective principle that the measure of the tariff above stated will permit the reduction of rates in certain schedules and will require the advancement of few if any" 	 0
"the proposal to revise the tariff made in such an authoritative way as to lead the business community to count upon it necessarily halts all those branches of business directly affected and as these are most important it disturbs the whole business of the country it is imperatively necessary therefore that a tariff bill be drawn in good faith in accordance with promises made before the election by the party in power and as promptly passed as due consideration will permit it is not that the tariff is more important in the long run than the perfecting of the reforms in respect to antitrust legislation and interstate commerce regulation but the need for action when the revision of the tariff has been determined upon is more immediate to avoid embarrassment of business to secure the needed speed in the passage of the tariff bill it would seem wise to attempt no other legislation at the extra session i venture this as a suggestion only for the course to be taken by congress upon the call of the executive is wholly within its discretion" 	 0
"in the mailing of a tariff bill the prime motive is taxation and the securing thereby of a revenue due largely to the business depression which followed the financial panic of 1907 the revenue from customs and other sources has decreased to such an extent that the expenditures for the current fiscal year will exceed the receipts by 100000000 it is imperative that such a deficit shall not continue and the framers of the tariff bill must of course have in mind the total revenues likely to be produced by it and so arrange the duties as to secure an adequate income should it be impossible to do so by import duties new kinds of taxation must be adopted and among these i recommend a graduated inheritance tax as correct in principle and as certain and easy of collection" 	 1
"the obligation on the part of those responsible for the expenditures made to carry on the government to be as economical as possible and to make the burden of taxation as light as possible is plain and should be affirmed in every declaration of government policy this is especially true when we are face to face with a heavy deficit but when the desire to win the popular approval leads to the cutting off of expenditures really needed t make the government effective and to enable it to accomplish its proper objects the result is as much to be condemned as the waste of government funds in unnecessary expenditure the scope of a modern government in what it can and ought to accomplish for its people has been widened far beyond the principles laid down by the old laissez faire school of political writers and this widening has met popular approval" 	 0
"in the department of agriculture the use of scientific experiments on a large scale and the spread of information derived from them for the improvement of general agriculture must go on" 	 1
"the importance of supervising business of great railways and industrial combinations and the necessary investigation and prosecution of unlawful business methods are another necessary tax upon government which did not exist half a century ago" 	 1
"the putting into force of laws which shall secure the conservation of our resources so far as they may be within the jurisdiction of the federal government including the most important work of saving and restoring our forests and the great improvement of waterways are all proper government functions which must involve large expenditure if properly performed while some of them like the reclamation of arid lands are made to pay for themselves others are of such an indirect benefit that this cannot be expected of them a permanent improvement like the panama canal should be treated as a distinct enterprise and should be paid for by the proceeds of bonds the issue of which will distribute its cost between the present and future generations in accordance with the benefits derived it may well be submitted to the serious consideration of congress whether the deepening and control of the channel of a great river system like that of the ohio or of the mississippi when definite and practical plans for the enterprise have been approved and determined upon should not be provided for in the same way" 	 0
"then too there are expenditures of government absolutely necessary if our country is to maintain its proper place among the nations of the world and is to exercise its proper influence in defense of its own trade interests in the maintenance of traditional american policy against the colonization of european monarchies in this hemisphere and in the promotion of peace and international morality i refer to the cost of maintaining a proper army a proper navy and suitable fortifications upon the mainland of the united states and in its dependencies" 	 0
"we should have an army so organized and so officered as to be capable in time of emergency in cooperation with the national militia and under the provisions of a proper national volunteer law rapidly to expand into a force sufficient to resist all probable invasion from abroad and to furnish a respectable expeditionary force if necessary in the maintenance of our traditional american policy which bears the name of president monroe" 	 0
"our fortifications are yet in a state of only partial completeness and the number of men to man them is insufficient in a few years however the usual annual appropriations for our coast defenses both on the mainland and in the dependencies will make them sufficient to resist all direct attack and by that time we may hope that the men to man them will be provided as a necessary adjunct the distance of our shores from europe and asia of course reduces the necessity for maintaining under arms a great army but it does not take away the requirement of mere prudence  that we should have an army sufficiently large and so constituted as to form a nucleus out of which a suitable force can quickly grow" 	 1
"what has been said of the army may be affirmed in even a more emphatic way of the navy a modern navy can not be improvised it must be built and in existence when the emergency arises which calls for its use and operation my distinguished predecessor has in many speeches and messages set out with great force and striking language the necessity for maintaining a strong navy commensurate with the coast line the governmental resources and the foreign trade of our nation and i wish to reiterate all the reasons which he has presented in favor of the policy of maintaining a strong navy as the best conservator of our peace with other nations and the best means of securing respect for the assertion of our rights the defense of our interests and the exercise of our influence in international matters" 	 0
"our international policy is always to promote peace we shall enter into any war with a full consciousness of the awful consequences that it always entails whether successful or not and we of course shall make every effort consistent with national honor and the highest national interest to avoid a resort to arms we favor every instrumentality like that of the hague tribunal and arbitration treaties made with a view to its use in all international controversies in order to maintain peace and to avoid war but we should be blind to existing conditions and should allow ourselves to become foolish idealists if we did not realize that with all the nations of the world armed and prepared for war we must be ourselves in a similar condition in order to prevent other nations from taking advantage of us and of our inability to defend our interests and assert our rights with a strong hand" 	 0
"in the international controversies that are likely to arise in the orient growing out of the question of the open door and other issues the united states can maintain her interests intact and can secure respect for her just demands she will not be able to do so however if it is understood that she never intends to back up her assertion of right and her defense of her interest by anything but mere verbal protest and diplomatic note for these reasons the expenses of the army and navy and of coast defenses should always be considered as something which the government must pay for and they should not be cut off through mere consideration of economy our government is able to afford a suitable army and a suitable navy it may maintain them without the slightest danger to the republic or the cause of free institutions and fear of additional taxation ought not to change a proper policy in this regard" 	 0
"the policy of the united states in the spanish war and since has given it a position of influence among the nations that it never had before and should be constantly exerted to securing to its bona fide citizens whether native or naturalized respect for them as such in foreign countries we should make every effort to prevent humiliating and degrading prohibition against any of our citizens wishing temporarily to sojourn in foreign countries because of race or religion" 	 0
"the admission of asiatic immigrants who cannot be amalgamated with our population has been made the subject either of prohibitory clauses in our treaties and statutes or of strict administrative regulation secured by diplomatic negotiation i sincerely hope that we may continue to minimize the evils likely to arise from such immigration without unnecessary friction and by mutual concessions between selfrespecting governments meantime we must take every precaution to prevent or failing that to punish outbursts of race feeling among our people against foreigners of whatever nationality who have by our grant a treaty right to pursue lawful business here and to be protected against lawless assault or injury" 	 1
"this leads me to point out a serious defect in the present federal jurisdiction which ought to be remedied at once having assured to other countries by treaty the protection of our laws for such of their subjects or citizens as we permit to come within our jurisdiction we now leave to a state or a city not under the control of the federal government the duty of performing our international obligations in this respect by proper legislation we may and ought to place in the hands of the federal executive the means of enforcing the treaty rights of such aliens in the courts of the federal government it puts our government in a pusillanimous position to make definite engagements to protect aliens and then to excuse the failure to perform those engagements by an explanation that the duty to keep them is in states or cities not within our control if we would promise we must put ourselves in a position to perform our promise we cannot permit the possible failure of justice due to local prejudice in any state or municipal government to expose us to the risk of a war which might be avoided if federal jurisdiction was asserted by suitable legislation by congress and carried out by proper proceedings instituted by the executive in the courts of the national government" 	 0
"one of the reforms to be carried out during the incoming administration is a change of our monetary and banking laws so as to secure greater elasticity in the forms of currency available for trade and to prevent the limitations of law from operating to increase the embarrassment of a financial panic the monetary commission lately appointed is giving full consideration to existing conditions and to all proposed remedies and will doubtless suggest one that will meet the requirements of business and of public interest" 	 0
"we may hope that the report will embody neither the narrow dew of those who believe that the sole purpose of the new system should be to secure a large return on banking capital or of those who would have greater expansion of currency with little regard to provisions for its immediate redemption or ultimate security there is no subject of economic discussion so intricate and so likely to evoke differing views and dogmatic statements as this one the commission in studying the general influence of currency on business and of business on currency have wisely extended their investigations in european banking and monetary methods the information that they have derived from such experts as they have found abroad will undoubtedly be found helpful in the solution of the difficult problem they have in hand" 	 0
"the incoming congress should promptly fulfill the promise of the republican platform and pass a proper postal savings bank bill it will not be unwise or excessive paternalism the promise to repay by the government will furnish an inducement to savings deposits which private enterprise can not supply and at such a low rate of interest as not to withdraw custom from existing banks it will substantially increase the funds available for investment as capital in useful enterprises it will furnish absolute security which makes the proposed scheme of government guaranty of deposits so alluring without its pernicious results" 	 1
"i sincerely hope that the incoming congress will be alive as it should be to the importance of our foreign trade and of encouraging it in every way feasible the possibility of increasing this trade in the orient in the philippines and in south america are known to everyone who has given the matter attention the direct effect of free trade between this country and the philippines will be marked upon our sales of cottons agricultural machinery and other manufactures the necessity of the establishment of direct lines of steamers between north and south america has been brought to the attention of congress by my predecessor and by mr root before and after his noteworthy visit to that continent and i sincerely hope that congress may be induced to see the wisdom of a tentative effort to establish such lines by the use of mail subsidies" 	 0
"the importance of the part which the departments of agriculture and of commerce and labor may play in ridding the markets of europe of prohibitions and discriminations against the importation of our products is fully understood and it is hoped that the use of the maximum and minimum feature of our tariff law to be soon passed will be effective to remove many of those restrictions" 	 0
"the panama canal will have a most important bearing upon the trade between the eastern and far western sections of our country and will greatly increase the facilities for transportation between the eastern and the western seaboard and may possibly revolutionize the transcontinental rates with respect to bulky merchandise it will also have a most beneficial effect to increase the trade between the eastern seaboard of the united states and the western coast of south america and indeed with some of the important ports on the east coast of south america reached by rail from the west coast" 	 0
"the work on the canal is making most satisfactory progress the type of the canal as a lock canal was fixed by congress after a full consideration of the conflicting reports of the majority and minority of the consulting board and after the recommendation of the war department and the executive upon those reports recent suggestion that something had occurred on the isthmus to make the lock type of the canal less feasible than it was supposed to be when the reports were made and the policy determined on led to a visit to the isthmus of a board of competent engineers to examine the gatun dam and locks which are the key of the lock type the report of that board shows nothing has occurred in the nature of newly revealed evidence which should change the views once formed in the original discussion the construction will go on under a most effective organization controlled by colonel goethals and his fellow army engineers associated with him and will certainly be completed early in the next administration if not before" 	 0
"some type of canal must be constructed the lock type has been selected we are all in favor of having it built as promptly as possible we must not now therefore keep up a fire in the rear of the agents whom we have authorized to do our work on the isthmus we must hold up their hands and speaking for the incoming administration i wish to say that i propose to devote all the energy possible and under my control to pushing of this work on the plans which have been adopted and to stand behind the men who are doing faithful hard work to bring about the early completion of this the greatest constructive enterprise of modern times" 	 0
"the governments of our dependencies in porto rico and the philippines are progressing as favorably as could be desired the prosperity of porto rico continues unabated the business conditions in the philippines are not all that we could wish them to be but with the passage of the new tariff bill permitting free trade between the united states and the archipelago with such limitations on sugar and tobacco as shall prevent injury to domestic interests in those products we can count on an improvement in business conditions in the philippines and the development of a mutually profitable trade between this country and the islands meantime our government in each dependency is upholding the traditions of civil liberty and increasing popular control which might be expected under american auspices the work which we are doing there redounds to our credit as a nation" 	 1
"i look forward with hope to increasing the already good feeling between the south and the other sections of the country my chief purpose is not to effect a change in the electoral vote of the southern states that is a secondary consideration what i look forward to is an increase in the tolerance of political views of all kinds and their advocacy throughout the south and the existence of a respectable political opposition in every state even more than this to an increased feeling on the part of all the people in the south that this government is their government and that its officers in their states are their officers" 	 0
"the consideration of this question can not however be complete and full without reference to the negro race its progress and its present condition the thirteenth amendment secured them freedom the fourteenth amendment due process of law protection of property and the pursuit of happiness and the fifteenth amendment attempted to secure the negro against any deprivation of the privilege to vote because he was a negro the thirteenth and fourteenth amendments have been generally enforced and have secured the objects for which they are intended while the fifteenth amendment has not been generally observed in the past it ought to be observed and the tendency of southern legislation today is toward the enactment of electoral qualifications which shall square with that amendment of course the mere adoption of a constitutional law is only one step in the right direction it must be fairly and justly enforced as well in time both will come hence it is clear to all that the domination of an ignorant irresponsible element can be prevented by constitutional laws which shall exclude from voting both negroes and whites not having education or other qualifications thought to be necessary for a proper electorate the danger of the control of an ignorant electorate has therefore passed with this change the interest which many of the southern white citizens take in the welfare of the negroes has increased the colored men must base their hope on the results of their own industry selfrestraint thrift and business success as well as upon the aid and comfort and sympathy which they may receive from their white neighbors of the south" 	 0
"there was a time when northerners who sympathized with the negro in his necessary struggle for better conditions sought to give him the suffrage as a protection to enforce its exercise against the prevailing sentiment of the south the movement proved to be a failure what remains is the fifteenth amendment to the constitution and the right to have statutes of states specifying qualifications for electors subjected to the test of compliance with that amendment this is a great protection to the negro it never will be repealed and it never ought to be repealed if it had not passed it might be difficult now to adopt it but with it in our fundamental law the policy of southern legislation must and will tend to obey it and so long as the statutes of the states meet the test of this amendment and are not otherwise in conflict with the constitution and laws of the united states it is not the disposition or within the province of the federal government to interfere with the regulation by southern states of their domestic affairs there is in the south a stronger feeling than ever among the intelligent welltodo and influential element in favor of the industrial education of the negro and the encouragement of the race to make themselves useful members of the community the progress which the negro has made in the last fifty years from slavery when its statistics are reviewed is marvelous and it furnishes every reason to hope that in the next twentyfive years a still greater improvement in his condition as a productive member of society on the farm and in the shop and in other occupations may come" 	 0
"the negroes are now americans their ancestors came here years ago against their will and this is their only country and their only flag they have shown themselves anxious to live for it and to die for it encountering the race feeling against them subjected at times to cruel injustice growing out of it they may well have our profound sympathy and aid in the struggle they are making we are charged with the sacred duty of making their path as smooth and easy as we can any recognition of their distinguished men any appointment to office from among their number is properly taken as an encouragement and an appreciation of their progress and this just policy should be pursued when suitable occasion offers" 	 1
"but it may well admit of doubt whether in the case of any race an appointment of one of their number to a local office in a community in which the race feeling is so widespread and acute as to interfere with the ease and facility with which the local government business can be done by the appointee is of sufficient benefit by way of encouragement to the race to outweigh the recurrence and increase of race feeling which such an appointment is likely to engender therefore the executive in recognizing the negro race by appointments must exercise a careful discretion not thereby to do it more harm than good on the other hand we must be careful not to encourage the mere pretense of race feeling manufactured in the interest of individual political ambition" 	 0
"personally i have not the slightest race prejudice or feeling and recognition of its existence only awakens in my heart a deeper sympathy for those who have to bear it or suffer from it and i question the wisdom of a policy which is likely to increase it meantime if nothing is done to prevent it a better feeling between the negroes and the whites in the south will continue to grow and more and more of the white people will come to realize that the future of the south is to be much benefited by the industrial and intellectual progress of the negro the exercise of political franchises by those of this race who are intelligent and well to do will be acquiesced in and the right to vote will be withheld only from the ignorant and irresponsible of both races" 	 1
"there is one other matter to which i shall refer it was made the subject of great controversy during the election and calls for at least a passing reference now my distinguished predecessor has given much attention to the cause of labor with whose struggle for better things he has shown the sincerest sympathy at his instance congress has passed the bill fixing the liability of interstate carriers to their employees for injury sustained in the course of employment abolishing the rule of fellowservant and the commonlaw rule as to contributory negligence and substituting therefor the socalled rule of comparative negligence it has also passed a law fixing the compensation of government employees for injuries sustained in the employ of the government through the negligence of the superior it has also passed a model childlabor law for the district of columbia in previous administrations an arbitration law for interstate commerce railroads and their employees and laws for the application of safety devices to save the lives and limbs of employees of interstate railroads had been passed additional legislation of this kind was passed by the outgoing congress" 	 0
"i wish to say that insofar as i can i hope to promote the enactment of further legislation of this character i am strongly convinced that the government should make itself as responsible to employees injured in its employ as an interstaterailway corporation is made responsible by federal law to its employees and i shall be glad whenever any additional reasonable safety device can be invented to reduce the loss of life and limb among railway employees to urge congress to require its adoption by interstate railways" 	 1
"another labor question has arisen which has awakened the most excited discussion that is in respect to the power of the federal courts to issue injunctions in industrial disputes as to that my convictions are fixed take away from the courts if it could be taken away the power to issue injunctions in labor disputes and it would create a privileged class among the laborers and save the lawless among their number from a most needful remedy available to all men for the protection of their business against lawless invasion the proposition that business is not a property or pecuniary right which can be protected by equitable injunction is utterly without foundation in precedent or reason the proposition is usually linked with one to make the secondary boycott lawful such a proposition is at variance with the american instinct and will find no support in my judgment when submitted to the american people the secondary boycott is an instrument of tyranny and ought not to be made legitimate" 	 0
"the issue of a temporary restraining order without notice has in several instances been abused by its inconsiderate exercise and to remedy this the platform upon which i was elected recommends the formulation in a statute of the conditions under which such a temporary restraining order ought to issue a statute can and ought to be framed to embody the best modern practice and can bring the subject so closely to the attention of the court as to make abuses of the process unlikely in the future the american people if i understand them insist that the authority of the courts shall be sustained and are opposed to any change in the procedure by which the powers of a court may be weakened and the fearless and effective administration of justice be interfered with" 	 0
"having thus reviewed the questions likely to recur during my administration and having expressed in a summary way the position which i expect to take in recommendations to congress and in my conduct as an executive i invoke the considerate sympathy and support of my fellowcitizens and the aid of the almighty god in the discharge of my responsible dutiesthere has been a change of government it began two years ago when the house of representatives became democratic by a decisive majority it has now been completed the senate about to assemble will also be democratic the offices of president and vicepresident have been put into the hands of democrats what does the change mean that is the question that is uppermost in our minds today that is the question i am going to try to answer in order if i may to interpret the occasion" 	 1
"it means much more than the mere success of a party the success of a party means little except when the nation is using that party for a large and definite purpose no one can mistake the purpose for which the nation now seeks to use the democratic party it seeks to use it to interpret a change in its own plans and point of view some old things with which we had grown familiar and which had begun to creep into the very habit of our thought and of our lives have altered their aspect as we have latterly looked critically upon them with fresh awakened eyes have dropped their disguises and shown themselves alien and sinister some new things as we look frankly upon them willing to comprehend their real character have come to assume the aspect of things long believed in and familiar stuff of our own convictions we have been refreshed by a new insight into our own life" 	 1
"we see that in many things that life is very great it is incomparably great in its material aspects in its body of wealth in the diversity and sweep of its energy in the industries which have been conceived and built up by the genius of individual men and the limitless enterprise of groups of men it is great also very great in its moral force nowhere else in the world have noble men and women exhibited in more striking forms the beauty and the energy of sympathy and helpfulness and counsel in their efforts to rectify wrong alleviate suffering and set the weak in the way of strength and hope we have built up moreover a great system of government which has stood through a long age as in many respects a model for those who seek to set liberty upon foundations that will endure against fortuitous change against storm and accident our life contains every great thing and contains it in rich abundance" 	 1
"but the evil has come with the good and much fine gold has been corroded with riches has come inexcusable waste we have squandered a great part of what we might have used and have not stopped to conserve the exceeding bounty of nature without which our genius for enterprise would have been worthless and impotent scorning to be careful shamefully prodigal as well as admirably efficient we have been proud of our industrial achievements but we have not hitherto stopped thoughtfully enough to count the human cost the cost of lives snuffed out of energies overtaxed and broken the fearful physical and spiritual cost to the men and women and children upon whom the dead weight and burden of it all has fallen pitilessly the years through the groans and agony of it all had not yet reached our ears the solemn moving undertone of our life coming up out of the mines and factories and out of every home where the struggle had its intimate and familiar seat with the great government went many deep secret things which we too long delayed to look into and scrutinize with candid fearless eyes the great government we loved has too often been made use of for private and selfish purposes and those who used it had forgotten the people" 	 0
"at last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole we see the bad with the good the debased and decadent with the sound and vital with this vision we approach new affairs our duty is to cleanse to reconsider to restore to correct the evil without impairing the good to purify and humanize every process of our common life without weakening or sentimentalizing it there has been something crude and heartless and unfeeling in our haste to succeed and be great our thought has been let every man look out for himself let every generation look out for itself while we reared giant machinery which made it impossible that any but those who stood at the levers of control should have a chance to look out for themselves we had not forgotten our morals we remembered well enough that we had set up a policy which was meant to serve the humblest as well as the most powerful with an eye single to the standards of justice and fair play and remembered it with pride but we were very heedless and in a hurry to be great" 	 0
"we have come now to the sober second thought the scales of heedlessness have fallen from our eyes we have made up our minds to square every process of our national life again with the standards we so proudly set up at the beginning and have always carried at our hearts our work is a work of restoration" 	 1
"we have itemized with some degree of particularity the things that ought to be altered and here are some of the chief items a tariff which cuts us off from our proper part in the commerce of the world violates the just principles of taxation and makes the government a facile instrument in the hand of private interests a banking and currency system based upon the necessity of the government to sell its bonds fifty years ago and perfectly adapted to concentrating cash and restricting credits an industrial system which take it on all its sides financial as well as administrative holds capital in leading strings restricts the liberties and limits the opportunities of labor and exploits without renewing or conserving the natural resources of the country a body of agricultural activities never yet given the efficiency of great business undertakings or served as it should be through the instrumentality of science taken directly to the farm or afforded the facilities of credit best suited to its practical needs watercourses undeveloped waste places unreclaimed forests untended fast disappearing without plan or prospect of renewal unregarded waste heaps at every mine we have studied as perhaps no other nation has the most effective means of production but we have not studied cost or economy as we should either as organizers of industry as statesmen or as individuals" 	 1
"nor have we studied and perfected the means by which government may be put at the service of humanity in safeguarding the health of the nation the health of its men and its women and its children as well as their rights in the struggle for existence this is no sentimental duty the firm basis of government is justice not pity these are matters of justice there can be no equality or opportunity the first essential of justice in the body politic if men and women and children be not shielded in their lives their very vitality from the consequences of great industrial and social processes which they can not alter control or singly cope with society must see to it that it does not itself crush or weaken or damage its own constituent parts the first duty of law is to keep sound the society it serves sanitary laws pure food laws and laws determining conditions of labor which individuals are powerless to determine for themselves are intimate parts of the very business of justice and legal efficiency" 	 1
"these are some of the things we ought to do and not leave the others undone the oldfashioned nevertobeneglected fundamental safeguarding of property and of individual right this is the high enterprise of the new day to lift everything that concerns our life as a nation to the light that shines from the hearthfire of every mans conscience and vision of the right it is inconceivable that we should do this as partisans it is inconceivable we should do it in ignorance of the facts as they are or in blind haste we shall restore not destroy we shall deal with our economic system as it is and as it may be modified not as it might be if we had a clean sheet of paper to write upon and step by step we shall make it what it should be in the spirit of those who question their own wisdom and seek counsel and knowledge not shallow selfsatisfaction or the excitement of excursions whither they can not tell justice and only justice shall always be our motto" 	 0
"and yet it will be no cool process of mere science the nation has been deeply stirred stirred by a solemn passion stirred by the knowledge of wrong of ideals lost of government too often debauched and made an instrument of evil the feelings with which we face this new age of right and opportunity sweep across our heartstrings like some air out of gods own presence where justice and mercy are reconciled and the judge and the brother are one we know our task to be no mere task of politics but a task which shall search us through and through whether we be able to understand our time and the need of our people whether we be indeed their spokesmen and interpreters whether we have the pure heart to comprehend and the rectified will to choose our high course of action" 	 0

"it is a record of singular variety and singular distinction but i shall not attempt to review it it speaks for itself and will be of increasing influence as the years go by this is not the time for retrospect it is time rather to speak our thoughts and purposes concerning the present and the immediate future" 	 0
"although we have centered counsel and action with such unusual concentration and success upon the great problems of domestic legislation to which we addressed ourselves four years ago other matters have more and more forced themselves upon our attention  matters lying outside our own life as a nation and over which we had no control but which despite our wish to keep free of them have drawn us more and more irresistibly into their own current and influence" 	 1
"it has been impossible to avoid them they have affected the life of the whole world they have shaken men everywhere with a passion and an apprehension they never knew before it has been hard to preserve calm counsel while the thought of our own people swayed this way and that under their influence we are a composite and cosmopolitan people we are of the blood of all the nations that are at war the currents of our thoughts as well as the currents of our trade run quick at all seasons back and forth between us and them the war inevitably set its mark from the first alike upon our minds our industries our commerce our politics and our social action to be indifferent to it or independent of it was out of the question" 	 1
"and yet all the while we have been conscious that we were not part of it in that consciousness despite many divisions we have drawn closer together we have been deeply wronged upon the seas but we have not wished to wrong or injure in return have retained throughout the consciousness of standing in some sort apart intent upon an interest that transcended the immediate issues of the war itself" 	 0

"there are many things still to be done at home to clarify our own politics and add new vitality to the industrial processes of our own life and we shall do them as time and opportunity serve but we realize that the greatest things that remain to be done must be done with the whole world for stage and in cooperation with the wide and universal forces of mankind and we are making our spirits ready for those things" 	 1

"that all nations are equally interested in the peace of the world and in the political stability of free peoples and equally responsible for their maintenance that the essential principle of peace is the actual equality of nations in all matters of right or privilege that peace cannot securely or justly rest upon an armed balance of power that governments derive all their just powers from the consent of the governed and that no other powers should be supported by the common thought purpose or power of the family of nations that the seas should be equally free and safe for the use of all peoples under rules set up by common agreement and consent and that so far as practicable they should be accessible to all upon equal terms that national armaments shall be limited to the necessities of national order and domestic safety that the community of interest and of power upon which peace must henceforth depend imposes upon each nation the duty of seeing to it that all influences proceeding from its own citizens meant to encourage or assist revolution in other states should be sternly and effectually suppressed and prevented" 	 1
"i need not argue these principles to you my fellow countrymen they are your own part and parcel of your own thinking and your own motives in affairs they spring up native amongst us upon this as a platform of purpose and of action we can stand together and it is imperative that we should stand together we are being forged into a new unity amidst the fires that now blaze throughout the world in their ardent heat we shall in gods providence let us hope be purged of faction and division purified of the errant humors of party and of private interest and shall stand forth in the days to come with a new dignity of national pride and spirit let each man see to it that the dedication is in his own heart the high purpose of the nation in his own mind ruler of his own will and desire" 	 1

"in conformity with the principle that a display of reason rather than a threat of force should be the determining factor in the intercourse among nations we have long advocated the peaceful settlement of disputes by methods of arbitration and have negotiated many treaties to secure that result the same considerations should lead to our adherence to the permanent court of international justice where great principles are involved where great movements are under way which promise much for the welfare of humanity by reason of the very fact that many other nations have given such movements their actual support we ought not to withhold our own sanction because of any small and inessential difference but only upon the ground of the most important and compelling fundamental reasons we can not barter away our independence or our sovereignty but we ought to engage in no refinements of logic no sophistries and no subterfuges to argue away the undoubted duty of this country by reason of the might of its numbers the power of its resources and its position of leadership in the world actively and comprehensively to signify its approval and to bear its full share of the responsibility of a candid and disinterested attempt at the establishment of a tribunal for the administration of evenhanded justice between nation and nation the weight of our enormous influence must be cast upon the side of a reign not of force but of law and trial not by battle but by reason" 	 0

"some of the best thought of mankind has long been seeking for a formula for permanent peace undoubtedly the clarification of the principles of international law would be helpful and the efforts of scholars to prepare such a work for adoption by the various nations should have our sympathy and support much may be hoped for from the earnest studies of those who advocate the outlawing of aggressive war but all these plans and preparations these treaties and covenants will not of themselves be adequate one of the greatest dangers to peace lies in the economic pressure to which people find themselves subjected one of the most practical things to be done in the world is to seek arrangements under which such pressure may be removed so that opportunity may be renewed and hope may be revived there must be some assurance that effort and endeavor will be followed by success and prosperity in the making and financing of such adjustments there is not only an opportunity but a real duty for america to respond with her counsel and her resources conditions must be provided under which people can make a living and work out of their difficulties but there is another element more important than all without which there can not be the slightest hope of a permanent peace that element lies in the heart of humanity unless the desire for peace be cherished there unless this fundamental and only natural source of brotherly love be cultivated to its highest degree all artificial efforts will be in vain peace will come when there is realization that only under a reign of law based on righteousness and supported by the religious conviction of the brotherhood of man can there be any hope of a complete and satisfying life parchment will fail the sword will fail it is only the spiritual nature of man that can be triumphant" 	 1
"it seems altogether probable that we can contribute most to these important objects by maintaining our position of political detachment and independence we are not identified with any old world interests this position should be made more and more clear in our relations with all foreign countries we are at peace with all of them our program is never to oppress but always to assist but while we do justice to others we must require that justice be done to us with us a treaty of peace means peace and a treaty of amity means amity we have made great contributions to the settlement of contentious differences in both europe and asia but there is a very definite point beyond which we can not go we can only help those who help themselves mindful of these limitations the one great duty that stands out requires us to use our enormous powers to trim the balance of the world" 	 0
"while we can look with a great deal of pleasure upon what we have done abroad we must remember that our continued success in that direction depends upon what we do at home since its very outset it has been found necessary to conduct our government by means of political parties that system would not have survived from generation to generation if it had not been fundamentally sound and provided the best instrumentalities for the most complete expression of the popular will it is not necessary to claim that it has always worked perfectly it is enough to know that nothing better has been devised no one would deny that there should be full and free expression and an opportunity for independence of action within the party there is no salvation in a narrow and bigoted partisanship but if there is to be responsible party government the party label must be something more than a mere device for securing office unless those who are elected under the same party designation are willing to assume sufficient responsibility and exhibit sufficient loyalty and coherence so that they can cooperate with each other in the support of the broad general principles of the party platform the election is merely a mockery no decision is made at the polls and there is no representation of the popular will common honesty and good faith with the people who support a party at the polls require that party when it enters office to assume the control of that portion of the government to which it has been elected any other course is bad faith and a violation of the party pledges" 	 1
"when the country has bestowed its confidence upon a party by making it a majority in the congress it has a right to expect such unity of action as will make the party majority an effective instrument of government this administration has come into power with a very clear and definite mandate from the people the expression of the popular will in favor of maintaining our constitutional guarantees was overwhelming and decisive there was a manifestation of such faith in the integrity of the courts that we can consider that issue rejected for some time to come likewise the policy of public ownership of railroads and certain electric utilities met with unmistakable defeat the people declared that they wanted their rights to have not a political but a judicial determination and their independence and freedom continued and supported by having the ownership and control of their property not in the government but in their own hands as they always do when they have a fair chance the people demonstrated that they are sound and are determined to have a sound government" 	 1
"when we turn from what was rejected to inquire what was accepted the policy that stands out with the greatest clearness is that of economy in public expenditure with reduction and reform of taxation the principle involved in this effort is that of conservation the resources of this country are almost beyond computation no mind can comprehend them but the cost of our combined governments is likewise almost beyond definition not only those who are now making their tax returns but those who meet the enhanced cost of existence in their monthly bills know by hard experience what this great burden is and what it does no matter what others may want these people want a drastic economy they are opposed to waste they know that extravagance lengthens the hours and diminishes the rewards of their labor i favor the policy of economy not because i wish to save money but because i wish to save people the men and women of this country who toil are the ones who bear the cost of the government every dollar that we carelessly waste means that their life will be so much the more meager every dollar that we prudently save means that their life will be so much the more abundant economy is idealism in its most practical form" 	 0
"if extravagance were not reflected in taxation and through taxation both directly and indirectly injuriously affecting the people it would not be of so much consequence the wisest and soundest method of solving our tax problem is through economy fortunately of all the great nations this country is best in a position to adopt that simple remedy we do not any longer need wartime revenues the collection of any taxes which are not absolutely required which do not beyond reasonable doubt contribute to the public welfare is only a species of legalized larceny under this republic the rewards of industry belong to those who earn them the only constitutional tax is the tax which ministers to public necessity the property of the country belongs to the people of the country their title is absolute they do not support any privileged class they do not need to maintain great military forces they ought not to be burdened with a great array of public employees they are not required to make any contribution to government expenditures except that which they voluntarily assess upon themselves through the action of their own representatives whenever taxes become burdensome a remedy can be applied by the people but if they do not act for themselves no one can be very successful in acting for them" 	 0
"the time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction when unless we wish to hamper the people in their right to earn a living we must have tax reform the method of raising revenue ought not to impede the transaction of business it ought to encourage it i am opposed to extremely high rates because they produce little or no revenue because they are bad for the country and finally because they are wrong we can not finance the country we can not improve social conditions through any system of injustice even if we attempt to inflict it upon the rich those who suffer the most harm will be the poor this country believes in prosperity it is absurd to suppose that it is envious of those who are already prosperous the wise and correct course to follow in taxation and all other economic legislation is not to destroy those who have already secured success but to create conditions under which every one will have a better chance to be successful the verdict of the country has been given on this question that verdict stands we shall do well to heed it" 	 0
"these questions involve moral issues we need not concern ourselves much about the rights of property if we will faithfully observe the rights of persons under our institutions their rights are supreme it is not property but the right to hold property both great and small which our constitution guarantees all owners of property are charged with a service these rights and duties have been revealed through the conscience of society to have a divine sanction the very stability of our society rests upon production and conservation for individuals or for governments to waste and squander their resources is to deny these rights and disregard these obligations the result of economic dissipation to a nation is always moral decay" 	 0
"these policies of better international understandings greater economy and lower taxes have contributed largely to peaceful and prosperous industrial relations under the helpful influences of restrictive immigration and a protective tariff employment is plentiful the rate of pay is high and wage earners are in a state of contentment seldom before seen our transportation systems have been gradually recovering and have been able to meet all the requirements of the service agriculture has been ver slow in reviving but the price of cereals at last indicates that the day of its deliverance is at hand" 	 1
"we are not without our problems but our most important problem is not to secure new advantages but to maintain those which we already possess our system of government made up of three separate and independent departments our divided sovereignty composed of nation and state the matchless wisdom that is enshrined in our constitution all these need constant effort and tireless vigilance for their protection and support" 	 1
"in a republic the first rule for the guidance of the citizen is obedience to law under a despotism the law may be imposed upon the subject he has no voice in its making no influence in its administration it does not represent him under a free government the citizen makes his own laws chooses his own administrators which do represent him those who want their rights respected under the constitution and the law ought to set the example themselves of observing the constitution and the law while there may be those of high intelligence who violate the law at times the barbarian and the defective always violate it those who disregard the rules of society are not exhibiting a superior intelligence are not promoting freedom and independence are not following the path of civilization but are displaying the traits of ignorance of servitude of savagery and treading the way that leads back to the jungle" 	 1
"the essence of a republic is representative government our congress represents the people and the states in all legislative affairs it is the natural collaborator with the president in spite of all the criticism which often falls to its lot i do not hesitate to say that there is no more independent and effective legislative body in the world it is and should be jealous of its prerogative i welcome its cooperation and expect to share with it not only the responsibility but the credit for our common effort to secure beneficial legislation" 	 1
"these are some of the principles which america represents we have not by any means put them fully into practice but we have strongly signified our belief in them the encouraging feature of our country is not that it has reached its destination but that it has overwhelmingly expressed its determination to proceed in the right direction it is true that we could with profit be less sectional and more national in our thought it would be well if we could replace much that is only a false and ignorant prejudice with a true and enlightened pride of race but the last election showed that appeals to class and nationality had little effect we were all found loyal to a common citizenship the fundamental precept of liberty is toleration we can not permit any inquisition either within or without the law or apply any religious test to the holding of office the mind of america must be forever free" 	 1

"enforcement of the eighteenth amendmentof the undoubted abuses which have grown up under the eighteenth amendment part are due to the causes i have just mentioned but part are due to the failure of some states to accept their share of responsibility for concurrent enforcement and to the failure of many state and local officials to accept the obligation under their oath of office zealously to enforce the laws with the failures from these many causes has come a dangerous expansion in the criminal elements who have found enlarged opportunities in dealing in illegal liquor" 	 0

"i have been selected by you to execute and enforce the laws of the country i propose to do so to the extent of my own abilities but the measure of success that the government shall attain will depend upon the moral support which you as citizens extend the duty of citizens to support the laws of the land is coequal with the duty of their government to enforce the laws which exist no greater national service can be given by men and women of good will  who i know are not unmindful of the responsibilities of citizenship  than that they should by their example assist in stamping out crime and outlawry by refusing participation in and condemning all transactions with illegal liquor our whole system of selfgovernment will crumble either if officials elect what laws they will enforce or citizens elect what laws they will support the worst evil of disregard for some law is that it destroys respect for all law for our citizens to patronize the violation of a particular law on the ground that they are opposed to it is destructive of the very basis of all that protection of life of homes and property which they rightly claim under other laws if citizens do not like a law their duty as honest men and women is to discourage its violation their right is openly to work for its repeal" 	 0

"those who have a true understanding of america know that we have no desire for territorial expansion for economic or other domination of other peoples such purposes are repugnant to our ideals of human freedom our form of government is ill adapted to the responsibilities which inevitably follow permanent limitation of the independence of other peoples superficial observers seem to find no destiny for our abounding increase in population in wealth and power except that of imperialism they fail to see that the american people are engrossed in the building for themselves of a new economic system a new social system a new political system all of which are characterized by aspirations of freedom of opportunity and thereby are the negation of imperialism they fail to realize that because of our abounding prosperity our youth are pressing more and more into our institutions of learning that our people are seeking a larger vision through art literature science and travel that they are moving toward stronger moral and spiritual life  that from these things our sympathies are broadening beyond the bounds of our nation and race toward their true expression in a real brotherhood of man they fail to see that the idealism of america will lead it to no narrow or selfish channel but inspire it to do its full share as a nation toward the advancement of civilization it will do that not by mere declaration but by taking a practical part in supporting all useful international undertakings we not only desire peace with the world but to see peace maintained throughout the world we wish to advance the reign of justice and reason toward the extinction of force" 	 1
"the recent treaty for the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy sets an advanced standard in our conception of the relations of nations its acceptance should pave the way to greater limitation of armament the offer of which we sincerely extend to the world but its full realization also implies a greater and greater perfection in the instrumentalities for pacific settlement of controversies between nations in the creation and use of these instrumentalities we should support every sound method of conciliation arbitration and judicial settlement american statesmen were among the first to propose and they have constantly urged upon the world the establishment of a tribunal for the settlement of controversies of a justiciable character the permanent court of international justice in its major purpose is thus peculiarly identified with american ideals and with american statesmanship no more potent instrumentality for this purpose has ever been conceived and no other is practicable of establishment the reservations placed upon our adherence should not be misinterpreted the united states seeks by these reservations no special privilege or advantage but only to clarify our relation to advisory opinions and other matters which are subsidiary to the major purpose of the court the way should and i believe will be found by which we may take our proper place in a movement so fundamental to the progress of peace" 	 1

"i have lately returned from a journey among our sister republics of the western hemisphere i have received unbounded hospitality and courtesy as their expression of friendliness to our country we are held by particular bonds of sympathy and common interest with them they are each of them building a racial character and a culture which is an impressive contribution to human progress we wish only for the maintenance of their independence the growth of their stability and their prosperity while we have had wars in the western hemisphere yet on the whole the record is in encouraging contrast with that of other parts of the world fortunately the new world is largely free from the inheritances of fear and distrust which have so troubled the old world we should keep it so" 	 0
"it is impossible my countrymen to speak of peace without profound emotion in thousands of homes in america in millions of homes around the world there are vacant chairs it would be a shameful confession of our unworthiness if it should develop that we have abandoned the hope for which all these men died surely civilization is old enough surely mankind is mature enough so that we ought in our own lifetime to find a way to permanent peace abroad to west and east are nations whose sons mingled their blood with the blood of our sons on the battlefields most of these nations have contributed to our race to our culture our knowledge and our progress from one of them we derive our very language and from many of them much of the genius of our institutions their desire for peace is as deep and sincere as our own" 	 0

"party responsibilitiesin our form of democracy the expression of the popular will can be effected only through the instrumentality of political parties we maintain party government not to promote intolerant partisanship but because opportunity must be given for expression of the popular will and organization provided for the execution of its mandates and for accountability of government to the people it follows that the government both in the executive and the legislative branches must carry out in good faith the platforms upon which the party was entrusted with power but the government is that of the whole people the party is the instrument through which policies are determined and men chosen to bring them into being the animosities of elections should have no place in our government for government must concern itself alone with the common weal" 	 0

"recognition of the falsity of material wealth as the standard of success goes hand in hand with the abandonment of the false belief that public office and high political position are to be valued only by the standards of pride of place and personal profit and there must be an end to a conduct in banking and in business which too often has given to a sacred trust the likeness of callous and selfish wrongdoing small wonder that confidence languishes for it thrives only on honesty on honor on the sacredness of obligations on faithful protection on unselfish performance without them it cannot live" 	 1

"hand in hand with this we must frankly recognize the overbalance of population in our industrial centers and by engaging on a national scale in a redistribution endeavor to provide a better use of the land for those best fitted for the land the task can be helped by definite efforts to raise the values of agricultural products and with this the power to purchase the output of our cities it can be helped by preventing realistically the tragedy of the growing loss through foreclosure of our small homes and our farms it can be helped by insistence that the federal state and local governments act forthwith on the demand that their cost be drastically reduced it can be helped by the unifying of relief activities which today are often scattered uneconomical and unequal it can be helped by national planning for and supervision of all forms of transportation and of communications and other utilities which have a definitely public character there are many ways in which it can be helped but it can never be helped merely by talking about it we must act and act quickly" 	 1
